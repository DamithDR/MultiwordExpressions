A mature magnolia in full bloom makes a spectacular sight 
in spring. Most magnolias are elegant in habit and though 
slow-growing, eventually form imposing trees and shrubs. 
The ﬂowers are generally saucer-, star-, or goblet-shaped  
and often have a subtle fragrance. Colors range from pure 
white, to white ﬂushed or stained with pink or purple, to 
pink and rich red-purple. The genus includes some evergreen, 
summer-ﬂowering species. These, and cultivars that are not 
fully hardy, are best planted against a sunny wall. Some 
magnolias prefer acidic or neutral soil, but most tolerate  
any soil provided it is humus-rich. Plenty of organic matter 
should be dug into the soil before planting. Avoid planting  
in exposed sites, as the ﬂowers can be damaged by frost.

Of the many ornamental features offered by trees, including 
ﬂowers, fruit, and foliage, it is probably bark that makes the 
greatest impact in a garden. This is partly because bark is  
not transient and offers interest every day of the year and 
throughout the mature life of the tree. Chosen carefully, trees 
with ornamental bark can lighten up the darkest corner and 
provide superb contrast to other plants. While maple (Acer), 
birch (Betula), and cherry (Prunus) are obvious choices, 
there are many other species with stunning, textured or 
colored bark, such as the patterned stems of eucalyptus  
and Stewartia. Some trees display their colorful bark from 
an early age, others may take a few years to develop—but  
the end result is well worth waiting for.

A genus of around 50 species of hardy plants, Cornus is 
perhaps best known for its shrubby dogwoods, such as  
Cornus alba ‘Sibirica’, which produce brightly colored winter 
stems. However, the ﬂowering trees within this genus have 
much to offer, as they are highly ornamental, ideal for small 
gardens, and easy to grow—many accommodating a wide 
range of soil types. The majority ﬂower in late spring or  
early summer. Their “ﬂowers” consist of a rounded hub of  
tiny blooms, surrounded by showy petal-like bracts, up to  
3in (7.5cm) across on some cultivars, which range in color 
from pure white, cream, and yellow to pink and red. In good 
summers, attractive, edible, strawberry-like fruits develop 
after ﬂowering. Several species, such as Cornus kousa, 
also produce striking fall leaf color.

S. forrestii S. cashmiriana t
S. esserteauana S. scalaris 
S. aucuparia tSORBUS
Comprising more than 100 hardy species, the genus Sorbus 
includes a wide range of ornamental trees ideal for small to 
medium-sized gardens. They provide a year-round display of  
color and interest, with fragrant corymbs of cream ﬂowers, 
attractive, divided foliage, vibrant fall color, and decorative 
berrylike fruits that last well into winter on some species.  
Most members of this genus fall into one of two categories: the 
Aucuparia group, which has pinnate leaves like rowan (Sorbus 
aucuparia), and the Aria group, which has rounded or oval leaves, 
such as whitebeam (Sorbus aria). Virtually all species are easy 
to grow and thrive in full sun or dappled shade, and in well-
drained, fertile, acidic or alkaline soil , although species within  
the Aucuparia group are not long-lived on shallow alkaline soils.

The common holly, Ilex aquifolium, is one of the best-known 
evergreen trees, but many other Ilex cultivars make attractive 
garden plants. In size they range from tall specimen trees  
to small shrubs. Leaves may be smooth-edged or spiny  
and vary in color, several having gold, yellow, cream,  
white, or gray variegation. Small, often white, male and 
female ﬂowers, borne on separate plants during summer,  
are followed by red, yellow, or black berries. In almost all 
cases, hollies are unisexual—that is, the berries are borne  
on female plants—soto obtain fruits it is usually necessary  
to grow plants of both sexes. When choosing, don’t rely  
on variety names to sex plants; I. aquifolium ‘Silver Queen’ 
is male. Hollies respond well to pruning and many  
can be clipped to form hedges.

Dwarf conifers are valuable plants, especially for the small 
garden, requiring little attention and providing year-round 
interest. They can be planted as features in their own right, 
for their varied shapes, habits, and often striking colors, 
or, in the rock garden, to provide scale or act as a foil for 
other plants such as bulbs. Several species and cultivars 
are spreaders and good for groundcover. Most conifers 
are suited to a wide range of growing conditions, although 
Cedrus and Juniperus do not tolerate shade, and Juniperus 
and Pinus are best for dry, sandy soils. Some species may 
be clipped to form a low hedge, but new growth seldom 
occurs from wood more than 3 or 4 years old. Dwarf 
conifers also make excellent container plants.
 SHRUBS
Shrubs are key to any planting design, and provide color  
and interest throughout the seasons with their wide variety  
of foliage, flowers, fruits, and stems. Create a year-round  
display with a selection of beautiful spring- and summer-
flowering shrubs, such as weigelas, buddlejas, and philadelphus, 
together with those that sport brightly colored fall fruits, such as 
pyracanthas and cotoneasters. You can then include witch hazels 
and some species of honeysuckle to brighten bleak winter 
months with their fragrant flowers. Whatever the size  
or style of your garden, the permanent woody structure of 
shrubs will form the framework, so make your selection and 
plant them before the perennials. Some shrubs are also  
ideal plants for hedges, enclosures, and screens.
108Star performers, shrubs form the backbone of many garden designs. 
They can be used together in shrub borders or with other plant groups 
in mixed displays. Providing color and interest with their foliage,  
flowers, and fruits, many also offer scented blooms and colorful stems. SHRUBS
What are shrubs?
Shrubs are woody-stemmed, deciduous or 
evergreen plants that branch out at or near 
ground level. Some can grow to more than 
20ft (6m) in height, although most attain less 
than half this size. Leaves come in many 
forms, from large and glossy to gray and 
needlelike. There is sometimes an overlap 
between shrubs and trees because larger 
shrubs, such as flowering dogwoods 
(Cornus species), can be grown on a single 
stem. Subshrubs are another anomaly,  
with woody stems at the base, but softer  
top growth that may die back over winter  
in colder regions, like a perennial. Examples 
include ceratostigmas and fuchsias. 
Choosing shrubs
When selecting shrubs, focus on those 
whose needs match your garden conditions. 
In general, shrubs with large, dark green 
leaves require shade; plants with gray 
foliage, such as lavender, require sun; and 
shrubs with colorful leaves need full sun  
or partial shade. Also consider the shrub’s 
size and site it where it has space to mature, 
unless you are planning a topiary display. Designing with shrubs
When creating a shrub display, try to 
combine plants with different shapes, 
habits, flower seasons, and foliage forms 
and patterns to create a visually balanced 
scheme and year-round interest. Knit them 
together in a shrub bed, or use them to 
provide a backdrop to more transient 
displays of bulbs, perennials, and annuals 
in a mixed border. 
The shape and habit of shrubs provides  
a design with structure and form. Contrast 
low, spreading, prostrate or mat-forming 
shrubs, such as Juniperus procumbens and 
Cotoneaster horizontalis, with more upright 
forms, such as Rosmarinus officinalis ‘Miss 
Jessopp’s Upright’, and the rounded shapes 
of bushy shrubs like hebes, skimmias,  
or boxwood topiary. Mix in shrubs with 
tiered branch structures, such as Viburnum 
plicatum ‘Mariesii’, which provide strong 
horizontal lines in a scheme. Graceful, 
arching shrubs, such as Kolkwitzia amabilis, 
Buddleja alternifolia, and Genista tenera 
‘Golden Shower’ add an elegant note. 
A wide range of shrubs are suitable for 
creating hedges, enclosures, or screens.

‘The Bride’ arch gracefully above forget-me-nots

Tulipa ‘Couleur Cardinal’./ssmall/hsmall/rsmall/usmall/bsmall/ssmall
2  Make final pruning cuts
Prune out any remaining 
crossing stems. Once you have  
cut back the tall growths, check 
where you can make your ﬁnal 
pruning cuts. Cut out the old 
growths completely to leave  
ﬁve or six strong young stems.1 Remove tall stems
Remove all dead and diseased 
wood, taking it back to healthy growth. 
Then prune back tall stems, removing 
them a little at a time so that they  
do not tear at the base. At this stage, 
cut the stems to about 24in (60cm) 
high, keeping in mind the plant’s 
balanced shape as you prune.3 Cut back 
remaining stems
Cut back the young healthy stems  
that are left, so that they are 12–16in 
(30–40cm) above the ground. The 
ﬁnal cuts should be at an angle so 
rainwater can run oﬀ. Later in the year, 
a mass of young shoots will appear 
along these stems (see left).
New growth after pruningRENOVATING A SHRUB 
overall appearance will be much improved. Other shrubs that respond 
well to this form of renovation include buddlejas, forsythias, kerrias, and 
smoke trees (Cotinus). Some, such as rosemary and lavender, do not.When evergreens such as mahonias have outgrown their allotted space, 
many can be cut back hard from mid-winter to early spring after ﬂowering. 
The plant may not ﬂower for two years after such drastic pruning, but its Large Medium Small 
over 10ft   5–10ft  up to 5ft
(3m) (1.5–3m) (1.5m) SIZE CATEGORIES USED WITHIN THIS GROUP
 109As well as evergreen staples like boxwood 
(Buxus), privet (Ligustrum), and shrubby 
honeysuckle (Lonicera nitida), which 
are commonly used, consider colorful 
deciduous shrubs, like the prickly Berberis 
thunbergii and its cultivars, or the 
evergreen Photinia 
x fraseri ‘Red Robin’, 
which produces fiery young foliage in 
spring and after clipping. 
Certain shrubs are also ideal for topiary, 
their small leaves lending themselves to 
detailed shaping. Suitable shrubs include 
boxwood and shrubby honeysuckle.
Shrubs such as fuchsias, hebes, fatsias, 
and choisyas are ideal for containers. 
Pots also limit the size of larger shrubs./ssmall/hsmall/rsmall/usmall/bsmall/ssmallKEEPING SHRUBS IN SHAPE
1 Assess your plant
In early summer, after daphnes have ﬂowered, 
young leggy shoots sprout from the main stems. 
Before cutting them back, take a look at the shrub  
to see where to cut to produce a well-shaped plant. Many young plants and shrubs, such as 
daphnes, produce long, leggy growths in spring 
or early summer after ﬂowering. They do not 
require major pruning, but a light trim will 
produce a more compact, bushy shrub that  
will be covered in ﬂowers the following year.
2 Shorten leggy growths
Using a pair of pruners, shorten the leggy 
growths by 6–8in (15–20cm). It is important that 
you always prune immediately above a leaf bud 
with an angled, slanting cut, as shown above. 
3 Work around the plant
Circle the plant, shortening each of the whippy 
stems, and checking that you are maintaining a  
good shape. The cut stems will then produce 
bushier growth and more ﬂowers the following year.
Feast of berries
The bright red berries of a female Skimmia japonica, 
produced where plants of both sexes are grown 
together, persist well into winter. Spring pastels
Ceanothus flowers appear in late spring, decorating  
the garden with various shades of blue and white. 
These short-lived evergreens enjoy a warm, sunny site.ABOVE: Contrasting foliage
The golden leaves of Choisya ternata Sundance (‘Lich’) 
provide a glowing contrast with the adjacent rich pink-
red Berberis thunbergii ‘Rose Glow’ and dark purple 
Cotinus coggygria ‘Royal Purple’.Year-round interest
There is a shrub in flower almost every 
month of the year. Interest begins in spring 
with a range of colorful varieties, including 
flowering currants (Ribes), ceanothus, and 
rhododendrons. The display continues  
with an abundance of summer-flowering 
shrubs like fuchsias, hydrangeas, buddlejas, 
and spiraeas, followed in fall by a range of 
colorful berries offered by plants such as 
pyracanthas, cotoneasters, and Skimmia 
japonica. Many shrubs retain their fruits 
into winter, providing birds and wildlife 
with a much-needed supply of food.
As temperatures fall, the fragrant flowers  
of witch hazel (Hamamelis), mahonias, and 
winter box (Sarcococca) open, bringing 
new interest to the garden. Combine these 
with the vivid stems of coppiced dogwoods 
(Cornus species) and variegated evergreens 
for a dramatic winter scheme.

6m0BUDDLEJAS
Buddleja is genus of approximately 100 species of highly 
ornamental evergreen and deciduous shrubs and small  
trees, originating predominantly in Asia, Africa, and the 
Americas. Buddlejas are often included in wildlife gardens 
as they encourage increased insect activity, which has 
earned one species the common name of butterﬂy bush, 
although they all also attract bees and hoverﬂies. They 
produce small, highly-scented, tubular ﬂowers borne in 
either plume-shaped or globular clusters. Easy to grow, 
they thrive in almost any soil, and perform best in a warm, 
sunny position. They are particularly suitable for growing 
against a south-facing wall.

‘Miss Kim’ 
S. komarowii subsp.reﬂexa S. vulgaris ‘Firmament’  LILACS
The heady scent of the lilac (Syringa) 
epitomizes early summer. Apart from 
the classic lilacs and mauves, colors 
include white, pink, cream, and rich 
red-purple; double forms are also 
available. Most lilacs grown in gardens 
are vigorous shrubs derived from  
S. vulgaris. They may eventually become 
treelike and are best planted at the back 
of a shrub border. Spent ﬂower heads 
should be removed, with care taken not 
to damage the new shoots. Otherwise, 
little pruning is required, though older 
plants may be rejuvenated by hard 
pruning in winter.

These evergreen shrubs and small 
trees have long been valued for  
their luxuriant, rich green foliage 
and masses of showy ﬂowers, in 
shades of white, pink, red, and 
yellow, borne mainly in winter and 
spring. Once thought suitable only 
for greenhouses, many camellias  
are hardy to Zone 6 if grown in 
sheltered positions, although blooms 
may suffer frost and rain damage. 
Ideal for shady gardens, they grow 
well against walls. Camellias require 
acidic soil but also make good 
container plants. The main ﬂower 
forms are illustrated below. 
Single—shallowly 
cup-shaped ﬂowers 
each have not more 
than 8 petals, arranged 
in a single row, and a 
conspicuous, central 
boss of stamens.
Semidouble—cup-
shaped ﬂowers each 
have 2 or more rows  
of 9–21 regular or 
irregular petals, and 
conspicuous stamens.
Anemone—rounded 
ﬂowers each have one 
or more rows of large, 
outer petals lying ﬂat or 
undulating; the domed 
centre has a mass of 
intermingled petaloids  
and stamens.
Peony-form—
rounded, domed 
ﬂowers have usually 
irregular petals 
intermingled with 
petaloids and stamens.
Rose-form—cup-
shaped ﬂowers each 
have several rows  
of overlapping petals 
and open to reveal 
stamens in the centre.
Formal double—
rounded ﬂowers have 
rows of regular, neatly 
overlapping petals  
that obscure stamens. 
Irregular double 
forms are similar but 
often have more loosely 
arranged, sometimes 
irregular, petals.

Rhododendrons and azaleas both belong to the huge  
genus Rhododendron, one of the largest in the plant 
kingdom. Azalea is the common name used for all the 
deciduous species and hybrids, and many of the dwarf, 
small-leaved evergreens. In stature the genus ranges from 
small alpine shrubs only a few inches high to tall, spreading 
trees, in the wild reaching 80ft (24m). Rhododendrons 
require well-drained, acidic soil rich in organic matter.  
Most prefer cool woodland conditions, although many  
dwarf forms thrive in more open sites. Many grow well in 
containers, in which it is often easier to provide suitable 
growing conditions. Once established, they require little 
attention apart from an annual mulch and occasional 
fertilizer, and provide a colorful display for years.

Shrubby members of the genus Cornus are justiﬁably 
popular among gardeners and landscape designers, 
admired for their highly ornamental brightly colored 
winter stems, ranging from lime green and yellow to 
orange and crimson, as well as their spring ﬂowers,  
and, in some cultivars, variegated foliage. Extremely 
hardy, dogwoods tolerate extreme cold and exposure. 
They also grow well on most soils, and require little 
maintenance—simply cut back the stems to just above 
the ground every two years in late winter. This promotes 
young growth, which has the most vibrant color.

Valued for their late summer ﬂowers, hydrangeas  
are versatile shrubs that thrive in a variety of situations. 
Larger-growing species, some of which may become  
treelike with age, are suited to light woodland, while the 
range of cultivars, mostly of H. macrophylla, make excellent 
border plants. Some may also be grown in containers. 
Colors range from white through pink, red, and purple  
to blue. The truest blue is obtained only on acidic soil. 
Lacecap hydrangeas have a central corymb of small,  
fertile ﬂowers surrounded by showy, colored bracts; 
mopheads (or hortensias) have domed heads of sterile  
bracts only. H. paniculata cultivars bear larger though 
fewer cone-shaped ﬂower heads if pruned hard in spring.

Most plants produce seeds in one form or another, but  
fruits and berries offer the best decorative value. Shrubs,  
in particular, offer a huge variety of berries in a range of 
colors, shapes, and sizes. Most appear from summer to  
late fall, with many enduring well into winter, brightening  
up the garden when color is in short supply, and providing  
an excellent source of nutrition for birds and wildlife. The 
most popular berried shrubs are cotoneaster, viburnum,  
and the snowberry (Symphoricarpos), with more unusual 
fruit produced by Clerodendrum trichotomum and Decaisnea 
fargesii, among others. Many of these plants are easy to 
grow, and will thrive in most soils, if given an annual 
application of all-purpose granular fertilizer in spring.

With their vivid blooms and long ﬂowering season,  
hardy fuchsias are outstanding garden shrubs. They  
ﬂower throughout the summer months, producing an 
abundance of vibrant, pendent, single to double ﬂowers, 
with ﬂared or elegantly recurved sepals. These range  
in color from deep red and purple to soft pink and pure 
white, and are often bicolored. Unlike tender varieties  
(see p.302), hardy fuchsias can be grown outside down  
to Zone 7 in full sun or partial shade. They require moist, 
well-drained soil, and can be grown in large containers.

Salvia is a vast genus of 900 species of mainly tender 
subshrubs or herbaceous perennials from North, Central, 
and South America and Africa. Most species have aromatic 
leaves and the foliage of common sage, Salvia ofﬁcinalis, has 
been cultivated for centuries for culinary and medicinal use. 
The ﬂowers of shrubby salvias, which are primarily white, 
pink, or red, are hooded and borne in whorls along the 
stems in summer and early fall. Most species are quite 
tender and need winter protection in frost-prone areas, 
although common sage and its cultivars are very hardy.  
S. microphylla will also withstand a few degrees of frost, 
but the others featured here are conservatory plants.  
Grow garden salvias in free-draining soil and full sun.

Lavandula is a popular genus of about 25 species of 
aromatic shrubs and herbs that originate predominantly  
from the Mediterranean region and northeast Africa,  
and thrive in hot, dry, sunny sites. Most have linear  
silver-gray foliage and produce erect spikes of fragrant 
ﬂowers in shades of white, pink, blue, or purple, depending 
on the type. They are versatile plants, and can be used to  
edge borders, paths, and hard landscaping, or against a 
backdrop of stonework, as a dwarf hedge or informal divide, 
or in association with roses for a typical “English style” effect. 
They are also excellent plants for coastal areas, coping well 
with salt-laden maritime breezes, and thrive in well-drained 
soil; they will suffer if planted in shade or wet soil.

As a group, heathers (or heaths) are remarkable in that 
species and cultivars are available to provide interest at 
alltimes of the year. Several are grown for their golden 
foliage, which often turns a deep burnt orange in winter, 
while others ﬂower for a long period during summer,  
fall, or winter. Flowers come in a variety of hues, and  
are occasionally bicolored. In habit, heathers vary from 
tree-heaths of up to 20ft (6m) to dwarf, prostrate forms, 
many of which are excellent as groundcover. There are  
three genera: Calluna, Daboecia, and Erica. All Calluna and 
Daboecia cultivars and most Erica species must be grown 
in acidic soil, but otherwise heathers require little attention.

 ROSES
These most romantic of flowers are unsurpassed in beauty and 
fragrance, and many people consider them indispensable 
features of the garden. With some 150 species and thousands  
of cultivars, both ancient and modern, there is a rose to suit 
almost any situation. They come from a wide range of habitats 
throughout the Northern Hemisphere and, with a few exceptions, 
most roses in cultivation are very hardy. They are also extremely 
versatile, and can be grown among bulbs, perennials, and other 
shrubs in a mixed border or in a more traditional formal rose 
garden. Climbing and rambling roses can be trained over 
arches, arbors, and pergolas, creating a blanket of scented 
blooms and beautiful foliage; or, if you have a small garden,  
you can plant a patio rose or two in a container.
170Prized for their beauty and fragrance, roses are considered the most 
romantic of flowers. They are indispensable in informal mixed planting 
schemes, and add an elegant note to formal parterres. With thousands  
of colors and forms to choose from, there is a rose for every garden.ROSES
ABOVE Container roses
Some roses have been bred specifically for containers, 
such as the patio rose 
REGENSBURG. Partner them with 
trailing annuals, such as Sutera cordata (syn. Bacopa). 
LEFT Formal dressing
Here, a sturdy arch clothed with clematis and a 
vigorous, free-flowering rambler lends height to

With some 150 species and thousands of 
cultivars, both ancient and modern, there 
are members of the genus Rosa to suit an 
enormous number of garden situations. 
They come from a wide range of habitats 
throughout the Northern Hemisphere and, 
with few exceptions, most roses are very 
hardy. Many modern roses combine the 
best qualities of old roses, such as flower 
shape and scent, with disease resistance 
and extended flowering seasons. 
When grown in a suitable site and soil, 
they will repay you with a profusion of 
blooms. All roses prefer an open, sunny  
site in fertile, humus-rich, moist but well-
drained soil. However, avoid planting them 
in an area where roses have been grown 
before because the soil may be affected  
by “rose sickness,” caused by a buildup of 
harmful soil organisms, and plants may fail 
to thrive. Roses also require a good supply of nutrients to perform well, and benefit 
from an annual application of all-purpose 
granular fertilizer in the spring.
Year-round interest
Although some roses, notably the climbers 
and species, bloom for a relatively short 
period, many hybrids are repeat-flowering, 
providing a colorful display throughout  
the summer. ‘Frühlingsmorgen’ offers  
the first flush of flowers in early summer, 
followed by the main flourish from mid-
summer to the first frost. To help maintain 
this display, deadhead your roses regularly, 
as this redirects the plant’s energy from 
seed formation to flower production. 
However, if you want attractive fruits (hips) 
in the fall, leave the blooms to fade. The best 
roses for hips include the Rugosa’s tomato-
like fruit, the flask-shaped, vibrant scarlet 
fruits of R. moyesii, and the rounded, black 
hips of R. pimpinellifolia.Ornamental features 
Roses embrace almost every color of the 
spectrum, apart from true blue, and some 
have a strong fragrance, such as the heady, 
sweet scent of the Damasks or musk and 
spicy fragrances of many modern roses. 
A few also have ornamental thorns, notably 
R. sericea subsp. omeiensis f. pteracantha, 
with large, triangular thorns that glow 
bloodred when they are backlit. 
Foliage can also provide interest. The  
soft gray-purple leaves of R. glauca and 
blue-green of the Alba roses provide 
attractive foils for crimson and purple 
flowers, while foliage textures, ranging 
from glossy to matt, and delicate fernlike  
to robustly wrinkled, as in R. rugosa, 
create beautiful contrasts.
Designing with roses
Roses have a diversity of habits, each  
of which can be used to create exciting 
designs. These include mound-forming 
groundcover roses, densely thorny 
Gallicas, and the arching Chinas and 
Damasks. A traditional rose garden laid 
out in a formal style with geometrically 
ordered beds is particularly suited to  
the upright growth of many bush roses. 
 171RIGHT Summer bedfellows
Alliums, bearded irises, campanulas, and verbascums 
provide perfect companions to a profusion of scented 
roses in a pink-and-blue-themed summer border. 
Regular deadheading will prolong the show. 
/rsmall/osmall/ssmall/esmall/ssmallIn contemporary schemes, shrub roses  
are often grown among bulbs, perennials, 
and other shrubs in a mixed border, but 
when designing these displays, make sure 
that neighboring plants do not compete 
directly for moisture and nutrients. Choose 
companions that are shallow-rooted, such as 
the many herbaceous geraniums and pinks 
(Dianthus cultivars), or space plants at a 
sufficient distance to allow for mulching 
and fertilizing around the rose’s root zone.
Climbing and rambling roses can be 
trained on a wall as a colorful backdrop,  
or on a trellis to form a screen. In addition, 
they provide a cloak of flowers and foliage 
when grown on arches and over arbors, 
and make focal points on freestanding 
features like tripods and pyramids. Large 
rampant ramblers, such as R. ‘Bobbie 
James’ and R. ‘Seagull’, which both can 
achieve 30ft (10m) or more, will quickly 
scramble through a tree, offering a 
profusion of blooms just after most tree 
blossoms have faded. 
Many climbing roses are available as 
weeping standards too. Tall cultivars of dense, thorny shrub roses, such as the 
Rugosa roses, also make decorative 
structural features. Use them to create 
large impenetrable boundary hedges that 
give privacy and security, or to divide up  
a garden into compartments. Vigorous 
groundcover roses are ideal for clothing 
PRUNING BUSH AND SHRUB ROSES 
Pruning floribunda roses
Also known as cluster-ﬂowered roses, ﬂoribundas 
produce ﬂushes of blooms through summer and 
early fall. In early spring, remove dead, diseased, 
and crossing stems. Prune the other stems to 
outward-facing buds 8–12in (20–30cm) from  
the ground using sloping cuts. Aim to leave a 
framework of 8 to 10 strong, healthy stems. Modern hybrid tea and ﬂoribunda roses, which are commonly grown  
in gardens, need hard pruning in late winter or early spring to 
encourage the production of new ﬂowering shoots. Shrub roses 
require a more gentle pruning regimen. Roses also beneﬁt from a  
light pruning in fall to prevent stems from blowing in the wind and 
rocking the plant, which may result in root damage. Pruning in a 
Pruning hybrid tea roses
These are large-ﬂowered roses, and include some 
varieties that repeat bloom, although they produce 
just one ﬂower per stem. In late winter or early spring, 
cut the oldest stems to the ground, and shorten  
the remainder to 6in (15cm) from the base. Leave 
three to ﬁve strong young stems after pruning, and 
angle cuts to allow water to drain oﬀ the buds.Pruning shrub and species roses 
These usually ﬂower once on wood made in 
previous years, so prune lightly in early spring. 
Remove dead, damaged, or diseased wood, and 
thin out congested growth to improve air ﬂow. 
Also cut some of the oldest stems to the ground. 
Cut main stems back by a quarter and slightly  
reduce side shoots by an inch or two.  methodical way has other horticultural advantages, helping to control 
attacks from fungal diseases such as black spot, to which roses are 
particularly susceptible, by removing infected wood. Before pruning,  
use a household disinfectant to clean your pruners, and apply it again 
before tackling each new plant to prevent the spread of disease. Also 
make sure your pruners are sharp, as clean cuts heal more quickly.sunny and inaccessible banks, since most 
require little regular pruning.
Not all roses will thrive in containers,  
but smaller patio roses such as R. 
ANNA 
FORD and R. REGENSBERG are a good choice,
while dwarf trailing or spreading cultivars 
are suitable for hanging baskets.

ADZ5–9 H9–5 ROSE CATEGORIES
Grown for the extraordinary beauty of their ﬂowers, 
roses have been in cultivation for hundreds of years. 
They have been widely hybridized, producing a vast 
number of shrubs suitable for growing as specimen 
plants, in the border, as hedges, and as climbers  
for training on walls, arbors, and pillars. Roses are 
classiﬁed into three main groups:
SPECIES 
Species, or wild, roses and species hybrids, which 
share most of the characteristics of the parent species, 
bear ﬂowers generally in one ﬂush in summer and  
hips in fall.
Old Garden roses
Alba—large, freely branching roses with clusters 
of ﬂowers in mid-summer and abundant, grayish- 
green foliage.
Bourbon—open, remontant shrub roses that may be 
trained to climb. Flowers are borne, often 3 to a cluster, 
in summer–fall.
China—remontant shrubs with ﬂowers borne singly 
or in clusters in summer–fall.
Damask—open shrubs bearing loose clusters of usually 
very fragrant ﬂowers, mainly in summer.
Gallica—fairly dense shrubs producing richly colored 
ﬂowers, often 3 to a cluster, in the summer months.
Hybrid Perpetual—vigorous, remontant shrubs with 
ﬂowers borne singly or in 3s in summer–fall.
Moss—often lax shrubs with a furry, mosslike growth 
on stems and calyx, and ﬂowers in summer.
Noisette—remontant climbing roses that bear large 
clusters of ﬂowers, with a slight spicy fragrance, in 
summer–fall. 
Portland—upright, rather dense, remontant shrubs 
bearing loose clusters of ﬂowers in summer–fall.
Provence (Centifolia)—lax, thorny shrubs bearing 
scented ﬂowers in summer.
Sempervirens—semievergreen climbing roses that 
bear numerous ﬂowers in late summer.
Tea—remontant shrubs and climbers with elegant, 
pointed buds that open to loose ﬂowers with a  
spicy fragrance.
Modern Garden roses
Shrub—a diverse group, illustrated here with the Old 
Garden roses because of their similar characteristics. 
Most are remontant and are larger than bush roses, 
with ﬂowers borne singly or in sprays in summer  
and/or fall. 
Large-ﬂowered bush (Hybrid Tea)—remontant shrubs 
with large ﬂowers borne in summer–fall.
Cluster-ﬂowered bush (Floribunda)—remontant 
shrubs with usually large sprays of ﬂowers in  
summer–fall. 
Dwarf clustered-ﬂowered bush (Patio)—neat, 
remontant shrubs with sprays of ﬂowers borne  
in summer–fall. 
Miniature bush—very small, remontant shrubs with 
sprays of tiny ﬂowers in summer–fall. 
Polyantha—tough, compact, remontant shrubs with

With the mass hybridization that has occurred  
in recent years, roses have been developed  
to produce plants with a wide variety of 
characteristics, in particular different forms  
of ﬂowers, often with a strong fragrance. These  
ﬂower types, illustrated below, give a general 
indication of the shape of the ﬂower in its perfect 
state (which in some cases may be before it has 
opened fully). Growing conditions may affect the 
form of the ﬂower. Flowers may be single (4–7 
petals), semidouble (8–14 petals), double (15–30 
petals), or fully double (over 30 petals).

R. rubiginosa HIPS AND THORNS
Roses have beautiful features that create interest for many 
months of the year. Although most are grown for their 
spectacular ﬂowers, many also produce decorative hips  
that provide glowing fall and winter color, offer birds 
avaluable source of food, and paint a stunning picture  
in frost and snow. Fertilized ﬂowers produce the hips,  
so avoid deadheading the blooms, as this will also remove  
the fruit. Thorns are another attractive feature on some 
species. For example, the winger thorn rose (R. sericea 
subsp. omeiensis f. pteracantha) has translucent thorns, 
while the ﬁne prickly thorns of moss roses look furry, 
adding to their attraction. Prune these roses hard to  
ensure a supply of young, thorny wood.

 CLIMBERS AND 
WA LL SHRUBS
Versatile and decorative, climbers offer great scope for 
imaginative garden design, their scrambling stems veiling other 
plants and structures with flowers and foliage. A few, such as 
ivy, will also trail across the ground, helping to suppress weeds. 
Climbers are often used as a backdrop to other plantings, or 
grown over arbors and gazebos to provide shade. You can also 
create focal points by weaving them through trees and pyramids 
and up pillars, or train them over a trellis to form boundary 
screens or dividers between different areas of the garden.  
The rigid stems of wall shrubs add another dimension to 
vertical schemes, covering walls and fences with  
foliage, blooms, and berries. 
190One of the most versatile of plant groups, climbers bring height to the garden, 
adding interest to walls and fences, and clothing structures such as arches and 
arbors with flowers and foliage. A number of shrubs can also be trained against 
walls and fences to create textures, patterns, and backdrops to beds and borders.CLIMBERS AND WALL SHRUBS
ABOVE Wisteria-clad wall
Vigorous climbers, such as Wisteria sinensis, need 
asturdy trellis or wall for support to display their  
heavy flowers to perfection. When grown around  
a window, the subtle scent of its flowers can be 
appreciated indoors and out./csmall/lsmall/ismall/msmall/bsmall/esmall/rsmall/ssmall /asmall/nsmall/dsmall /wsmall/asmall/lsmall/lsmall /ssmall/hsmall/rsmall/usmall/bsmall/ssmall What are climbers  
and wall shrubs?
Most climbers are woody, evergreen  
or deciduous plants, while a few are 
herbaceous perennials, or summer-
flowering annuals. Climbers can be self-
clinging or twining (with or without 
tendrils), or scandent—scrambling species 
that do not cling. It is important to identify 
the climbing method of your plant, since 
this dictates the method of support it needs.
Self-clingers such as Virginia creeper 
(Parthenocissus quinquefolia) climb up 
their supports using adhesive pads, while 
ivies (Hedera) and the Swiss cheese plant 
(Monstera deliciosa) use aerial roots to 
attach themselves to vertical surfaces.  
Self-clinging climbers may initially need  
to be guided to their support with canes 
(see box below) but will then become  
self-supporting. By contrast, twiners coil around the slim stems of a host plant; they 
will need wires, mesh, or a trellis to cling  
to if they are wall-trained. Clematis, passion 
flowers (Passiflora), hops (Humulus lupulus), 
sweet peas (Lathyrus), and morning glories 
(Ipomoea) fall into this group. 
Scrambling plants like winter jasmine 
(Jasminum nudiflorum) attach themselves 
loosely by threading their flexible stems 
through host plants or over a framework  
of their old stems made in previous seasons. 
On smooth surfaces, such as walls and 
fences, their stems must be tied in to wires 
or trellis attached to the support, as they 
have no other means of clinging.Wall shrubs such as chaenomeles, 
pyracanthas, and ceanothus are not natural 
climbers, but can be trained to decorate 
walls or fences. Some are best grown in 
this way, as they require the additional 
shelter and support a wall provides. 
Ornamental features
Climbing plants have a range of attractive 
foliage forms, from the lobed leaves of 
Tropaeolum speciosum and palmate foliage 
of x Fatshedera lizei, to the heart-shaped 
leaves of Actinidia deliciosa. Leaf surfaces 
also offer textural contrasts, from the 
downy Vitis vinifera to glossy ivies (Hedera).
1 Dig a planting hole
Water the climber before planting. Dig a hole 
twice the diameter and deeper than the rootball, 
18in (45cm) from the fence. Dig a slightly deeper 
hole for clematis, since they need to be planted  
4in (10cm) deeper than the top of their rootball.2 Plant the climber
Arrange a fan of canes in the hole. Place the 
climber in the hole and slant it toward the canes. 
Backﬁll with some soil enriched with rotted organic 
matter. Untie the stems from their original support 
and spread them out ready to attach to the canes.PLANTING A CLIMBER
Before planting, attach eye screws and horizontal wires, or a trellis, to the wall  
or fence. The lowest wire should be about 20in (50cm) above soil level, and the 
others 12–18in (30–45cm) apart. Work plenty of organic matter into the soil. 
3 Tie in the stems
Using soft garden twine, tie the stems to the 
canes using a ﬁgure-eight. Train the lower stems  
on to the lower wires and any tall stems at the 
center of the plant to cover the high wires. 4 Firm in the soil
Firm in the climber and create a shallow saucer 
shape around the base of the plant so that moisture 
runs into the area above the roots. Water, and apply 
a bark mulch, keeping it away from the plant stems.
 191ABOVE Clematis ‘Bill MacKenzie’
This small-flowered, late-blooming Group 3 clematis 
provides a natural, rambling backdrop of nodding 
yellow flowers and fluffy seedheads.
/csmall/lsmall/ismall/msmall/bsmall/esmall/rsmall/ssmall /asmall/nsmall/dsmall /wsmall/asmall/lsmall/lsmall /ssmall/hsmall/rsmall/usmall/bsmall/ssmall Colors range from golden-hued Humulus 
lupulus ‘Aureus’ to the deep green of many 
jasmines, as well as the purple tints of 
plants such as Vitis vinifera ‘Purpurea’. 
Others have bright, variegated foliage, 
such as Actinidia kolomikta, with its green 
leaves tipped with splashes of cream and 
pink. Some, most notably species of vitis 
and parthenocissus, produce their finest 
displays in fall, when both fire up with 
burning shades of red. 
Climbers such as passion flowers 
(Passiflora) and clematis bear beautiful 
flowers, while some, especially wisteria, 
honeysuckles (Lonicera), and jasmines, 
are deliciously fragrant. The flower colors 
span the spectrum from the creamy 
whites of Schizophragma integrifolium 
and Hydrangea petiolaris to the magentas 
of bougainvillea, blues and purples of a 
whole range of clematis, and chocolate-
maroon of Rhodochiton atrosanguineus. 
With many climbers, the season is further 
prolonged by silky seed heads, as in 
clematis, or striking berries, notably  
the oblong, purple fruits of Billardiera 
longiflora and the orange-yellow fruits 
of Celastrus orbiculatus. 
Annual climbers such as sweet peas 
(Lathyrus odoratus) climb rapidly to the 
top of wigwams made from garden canes, 
producing a succession of scented flowers 
from mid- to late summer that are ideal for 
cutting. Morning glory (Ipomoea tricolor 
‘Heavenly Blue‘), with its sky-blue trumpets, and black-eyed Susan (Thunbergia alata), also 
offer a quick-fix solution, covering a trellis or 
adding height to containers on patios.
Wall shrubs are also valued for their 
attractive foliage and blooms. Ceanothus, 
for example, has both evergreen and 
deciduous forms, with flowers in varying 
shades of blue, white, and pink. The 
flowering quince (Chaenomeles) produces 
a profusion of cupped white, pink, orange, 
or scarlet-red flowers early in the year, 
followed by yellow fruits in the fall. Thorny 
pyracanthas make excellent security hedges, 
deterring intruders, and sport glossy 
evergreen foliage with an abundance of 
yellow, orange, or red berries in the fall.
Designing with climbers 
and wall shrubs
Growing climbers as a backdrop for other 
plants is one way of adding height to a 
border, but they can also be grown on 
freestanding supports to form screens or 
divisions between different parts of the 
garden. Grown through trees or on pillars 
and pyramids, they also create focal points.
Where a garden lacks shade, climbers 
allowed to ramble over arches and arbors 
offer a cool place to sit. You can also use 
climbers and wall shrubs to soften the  
lines of hard landscaping, while vigorous 
climbers will help to camouflage unsightly 
structures. Left unsupported, some climbers 
trail on the ground and, when pegged at the 
Pruning Group 2 clematis
Prune this group in early spring when the buds  
are in growth and are clearly visible. Work from  
the top of the clematis, pruning each stem back  
to the ﬁrst pair of healthy buds or shoots. Remove 
dead, diseased, or damaged wood; it will be  
brown and dry. The pruned stems will produce 
new growth and then ﬂowers in early summer. Pruning Group 1 clematis
Plants in this group need little or no pruning  
once established, except to remove dead  
and damaged stems, or to keep them in  
check. After ﬂowering, give them a light trim  
if necessary. Prune the leggy new season’s  
growth, cutting above a pair of healthy buds,  
but do not cut them back hard.Pruning Group 3 clematis
Left unpruned, these clematis form ﬂowers at 
the top of the plant, leaving bare, straggly stems 
at the bottom. In late winter, before the buds break, 
remove the tangle of shoots from their support and 
cut back all the stems hard to within 12in (30cm) 
of the ground. This encourages strong new shoots 
and ﬂowers to form along their length.PRUNING CLEMATIS
Some clematis ﬂower well if pruned lightly or not at all, while others 
bloom more eﬀectively when cut back hard. They are divided into three 
groups, each with diﬀerent pruning requirements. Group 1 clematis 
(including 
C. montana  and C. armandii ) are vigorous plants that ﬂower 
in late spring on the previous year’s growth. Group 2 clematis, such as C. ‘Corona’, and C. ‘Henryi’, ﬂower in early summer on the previous 
year’s growth. Group 3 clematis include small-ﬂowered viticella and 
texensis types, such as 
C. ‘Gravetye Beauty’, and some large-ﬂowered 
types including 
C. ‘Perle d’Azur’. They bloom from mid-summer to fall 
on new growth formed earlier in the year.nodes, will root to form a carpet of 
groundcover. When growing climbers 
through other plants, make sure that you 
synchronize their flowering times for a  
dual effect, and match their pruning needs. 
As well as growing shrubs such as 
pyracanthas and chaenomeles against 
walls, you can train them into fans and 
espaliers for a formal effect.

Among the climbers, clematis are unsurpassed in their long 
period of ﬂowering (with species ﬂowering in almost every 
month of the year), the variety of ﬂower shapes and colors,  
and their tolerance of almost any exposure and climate.  
Some spring-ﬂowering species and cultivars are vigorous  
and excellent for rapidly covering buildings, old trees, and 
pergolas. Other, less rampant cultivars display often large, 
exquisite blooms from early summer to fall in almost every 
color. Flower colors may vary according to your climatic 
conditions; generally speaking, the warmer the climate, the 
darker the ﬂowers are likely to be. 
Clematis look attractive when trained on walls or trellises 
and when grown in association with other climbers, trees,  
or shrubs, treating them as hosts. Less vigorous cultivars  
may also be left unsupported to scramble at ground level, 
where their ﬂowers will be clearly visible. 
The various types of clematis (see the Plant Dictionary) may 
be divided into 3 groups, each of which has different pruning 
requirements. Incorrect pruning may result in cutting out  
the stems that will produce ﬂowers in the current season,  
so the following guidelines should be followed closely. 
Group 3 
Late, large-ﬂowered cultivars,  
Late-ﬂowering species, Small-ﬂowered 
cultivars, and Herbaceous types
Flowers are produced on the current 
season’s growth only, so prune before  
new growth starts, in early spring.  
Remove all of the previous season’s stems 
down to a pair of strong, leaf-axil buds,  
6–12 in (15-30 cm) above the soil.Group 2 
Early, large-ﬂowered cultivars
Flowers are produced on short, 
current-season stems, so prune 
before new growth starts, in early 
spring. Remove dead or damaged 
stems and cut back all others to 
where strong, leaf-axil buds are 
visible. (These buds will produce 
the ﬁrst crop of ﬂowers.)Group 1 
Early-ﬂowering species, Alpina, 
Macropetala, and Montana types 
Flower stems are produced direct from 
the previous season’s ripened stems. 
Prune after ﬂowering to allow new 
growth to be produced and ripened 
forthe next season. Remove dead or 
damaged stems and cut back other shoots 
that have outgrown their allotted space. Flower stem

Wisterias are large, vigorous, deciduous climbers that  
ﬂower in late spring to early summer, producing pendent 
racemes 18in (45cm) long or more, of scented, pealike 
ﬂowers. These open in shades of white through pale lilac-
blue to dark purple, and are sweetly scented. Often seen 
growing on arches and arbors, wisterias need strong 
support, as they become heavy with age, and their roots  
may damage building foundations. They prefer fertile, moist, 
well-drained soil in full sun or partial shade. Unless the soil 
is very poor, don’t fertilize them, as this encourages excess 
growth. Choosing wisteria can be confusing because many 
varieties are commonly mislabeled.

 PERENNIALS
One of the largest plant groups, perennials offer seasonal color, 
fragrance, form and texture, with a wealth of plants to suit  
every size and style of garden. They are traditionally grown  
in herbaceous borders, using a wall or hedge as the backdrop  
for the main summer display, but since most gardens are not 
large enough for long borders solely devoted to perennials, they 
are usually grown in mixed borders, together with shrubs, 
annuals, biennials, and bulbs that extend the seasons of interest. 
Although some perennials are evergreen, most die back in fall 
and emerge again in spring. While this can leave borders bare in 
winter, the seedheads and dried stems of some perennials, 
including rudbeckias, echinops, and sedums, provide  
a beautiful display when others have disappeared.

ABOVE Frosted seedheads
Most perennials die down in winter, leaving borders 
bare, but a few, such as Echinacea purpurea ‘Kim’s 
Knee High’ form decorative seedheads that remain  
for many months in winter.
LEFT Contrasting colors and forms

subsp. glaucum, nepetas, verbascums, and foxgloves. 
Contrasting flower forms intensify the effect.that create a spectacular display in summer. 
Today, many people do not have space for 
such a scheme, and perennials are now 
more commonly used in smaller beds and 
borders with other plants, such as shrubs, 
bulbs, and annuals. However, the design 
ideas employed in these large borders can 
be used in more modest schemes, with tall 
plants sited at the back, midrange types in 
the middle, and compact perennials planted 
at the front, ensuring that all can be seen 
clearly and no plants are obscured by taller 
neighbors. Plants are grouped in swaths of 
three or more of the same species, which 
lends borders a visual unity and rhythm. 
Groups of tall verbascums, eupatoriums, 
and delphiniums create a backdrop for the 
border plants in front, while low, ground-
covering perennials such as Cerastium 
tomentosum and Stachys byzantina are 
ideal at the front. Superb effects can then  
be created by using large specimens as   
a focal points, especially those that have   
an architectural form, such as cardoons 
(Cynara cardunculus) and bear’s breeches 
(Acanthus), or a tall grass such as a 
miscanthus or Stipa gigantea. 
Introduce variety of shape and texture  
by combining the rounded forms of sedums 
and geraniums with the upright spires of 
Kniphofia or salvias, for instance, or finely-
cut Corydalis flexuosa leaves with the What are perennials?
Perennials are nonwoody plants that live  
for two or more years and, when mature, 
produce flowers annually. The term often 
includes grasses and ferns. Although  
some perennials are evergreen, most  
are herbaceous and will die back each  
fall, emerging again in spring.
Choosing perennials
When making your selections, first check 
that the plants suit the climate, exposure, 
soil type, and light levels in your garden. 
Plants struggling in unsuitable conditions 
will not fulfill their intended purpose if 
they fail to flower or grow to fill their 
allotted space. The best results are usually 
achieved by grouping plants with similar cultivation needs; you may also find 
inspiration for garden planting schemes by 
looking at natural landscapes for symbiotic 
planting groups. For example, a deciduous 
woodland may feature a range of shade-
loving ferns that marry well together.
When perennials are massed together in 
borders, consider their eventual height and 
spread to ensure vigorous types do not 
overshadow or swamp more delicate plants.
Designing with 
perennials
Long herbaceous borders, often 10ft (3m) 
or more in depth, flanked by mowed lawn 
and backed by a wall or hedge, were 
traditionally planted with perennials Large Medium Small

 215/psmall/esmall/rsmall/esmall/nsmall/nsmall/ismall/asmall/lsmall/ssmallDIVIDING PERENNIALS 
1 Dig up the plant
In early spring, select a clump of plants and 
water them well. Cut back any old top growth to  
the ground. Using a fork, lift the clump of plants, 
taking great care to keep the whole rootball intact.This easy method of propagation can be used 
to propagate most herbaceous perennials as 
well as to rejuvenate large, tired clumps that  
are no longer ﬂowering well. You can also  
divide newly bought perennials, provided  
they are large enough and have clearly divisible 
stems, to make the most of your purchases. 
Most perennials can be divided in fall or early 
spring just as the shoots appear.
2 Divide with forks
Cut solid crowns into portions with a spade  
or old bread knife. If you cannot pry other pieces 
apart by hand, use two forks held back-to-back  
to split the clump into smaller sections.
3 Replant the divisions
Discard the dead central portions of overgrown 
clumps. Replant healthy, hand-sized pieces with 
strong buds in soil improved with well-rotted organic 
matter, such as manure. Water in well.Using twiggy sticks
Plants with moundlike growth 
will grow through and be 
supported by twiggy sticks 
placed around stems in spring.Using canes
Bamboo canes are ideal for 
supporting tall ﬂowers such as 
delphiniums. Use soft twine to 
tie the stems to the supports.Using metal spirals
Metal spirals provide good 
support for perennials such  
as this Pimpinella and also 
make decorative features. STAKING BORDER PERENNIALS 
Many tall perennials, such as delphiniums and achilleas, become top-heavy and 
require some form of support. If you provide plant supports early in the season, 
the plants will grow through and disguise them. Plants staked at a later date, 
especially once they have already ﬂopped, always tend to look trussed up. ABOVE Contrasting foliage
In damp, dappled shade, elegant contrasts of foliage 
form and texture create an atmosphere of lush 
abundance. A selection of bergenias, hostas, ferns,  
and ligularias are included in this lush scheme.bolder outlines of hostas in shady areas.  
Or use the stems of bleeding heart (Dicentra 
spectabilis) and Polygonatum x hybridum to 
gracefully arch over shorter plants, such as 
heucheras and Alchemilla mollis.
When making your selections, consider 
the foliage shape, form, and texture as  
well as flower colors. The boldly pleated 
foliage of veratrums and delicate, pinnate 
leaves of Polemonium caeruleum are worthy 
of consideration, while furry verbascums 
are seductively tactile. 
The disadvantage of planting herbaceous 
perennials is that the garden looks bare in 
winter, unless you plant sturdy types with 
long-lasting seedheads, such as sedum, rudbeckias, and many grasses. These can 
be left to stand and provide interest until 
new shoots appear in spring. Prairie-style 
schemes use these types of plants for year-
round interest; rather than planting in long 
borders, perennials and grasses are used  
in large bold groups, with tall see-through 
plants in front of shorter ones. Just a  
few plant species are used, and repeated  
to mirror nature. The effects of prairie 
schemes are best seen in larger gardens.

Admired for their cone and daisylike 
ﬂowers, Echinacea cultivars have 
expanded their repertoire; while once 
they were restricted to purple, pink,  
and white, a range of green, orange, 
yellow, and red ﬂowers are now 
available, as well as double-ﬂowered 
forms. They create bold and beautiful 
late summer and early fall displays,  
and the faded ﬂower heads also offer 
structural interest into winter. Grow 
plants in well-drained, humus-rich soil 
in full sun, although they will tolerate 
some shade. Protect young plants  
from slug and snail damage.

ADt Z5–9  H9–5JAPANESE ANEMONES
These useful plants ﬁll the late summer and early fall 
garden with single or double ﬂowers held on slender 
stems above handsome, divided, groundcovering foliage. 
The blooms are available in white and shades of pink  
and purple and are ideal for the middle to back of mixed 
borders, and in woodland gardens, injecting interest 
when many other ﬂowers have faded. Border anemones 
are easy to grow, and thrive in a wide range of soil 
conditions and in sun or light shade. Once the plants  
are established, they develop into large clumps,  
which can be lifted and divided in fall or spring.

Few other perennials show such diversity of ﬂower color  
as irises; and you will ﬁnd one for almost every position in  
the garden. They have a long ﬂowering season, the earliest 
appearing in the ﬁrst months of the year, the latest in  
early fall. Their ﬂowers often have “beards” (short hairs)  
or crests that add to their appeal, while a few are grown  
for their foliage or seed heads. The genus is classiﬁed into  
many divisions. Of these, the easiest to grow are the bearded, 
crested, and Xiphium irises. Siberian and Japanese types  
are ideal for bog gardens or watersides, but they will tolerate 
drier sites. Juno, Oncocyclus, and Regelia irises are more 
difﬁcult to grow, though their beautiful ﬂowers are worth  
the effort. For more information, see the Plant Dictionary.

Commonly known as columbines, Aquilegia are ideal 
cottage garden plants, well suited to growing in borders, 
rock gardens, and as ﬁllers between summer-ﬂowering 
shrubs. Most are graceful, elegant plants with divided basal 
foliage topped in late spring and summer by a succession  
of delicate, bell-shaped, usually spurred ﬂowers, although 
some have rounded double blooms. They vary in color  
from light and dark blue, purple, almost black, dark red,  
and pink, to orange, yellow, and white; many are bicolored. 
Aquilegia thrive in moist but well-drained soil, and full 
sun or dappled shade. They are normally raised from seed, 
which is freely produced, and once established, they tend  
to self-seed, although most do not come true to type.

Peonies (Paeonia species and cultivars) are valued for their 
showy blooms, ﬁlling borders with whites, pinks, yellows, and 
reds in late spring and early to mid-summer. Flowers include 
single, double, or anemone forms (with broad, outer petals 
and a mass of petaloids in the center); some are scented. They 
may need support when in full bloom and make good cut 
ﬂowers. The foliage is striking, too, often tinged bronze when 
young and rich red in fall. As well as many attractive species 
and a wide range of herbaceous hybrids, there are several 
tree peonies (cultivars of P. suffruticosa), and intersectional 
hybrids, which are crosses between the latter two. Peonies 
prefer sun but will tolerate light shade, and need rich, well-
drained soil. These long-lived plants resent transplanting  
and are best left undisturbed.

These elegant, colorful, tough perennials are useful  
plants for moist sites. Their feathery plumes open  
mainly in summer and are composed of hundreds, 
sometimes thousands, of tiny ﬂowers that create  
diverse forms, from dense and upright to open and 
arching. Colors range from white through shades  
of pink to deep reds and purples. The blooms are set 
against neatly lobed or divided foliage, which, in some 
cultivars, has attractive metallic, bronze, or red tints.  
All prefer moist soil—they tolerate clay well—in sun  
or partial shade, and they make compact clumps in  
bog or waterside gardens. Watch out for signs of plant  
collapse as astilbes are susceptible to vine weevil attack.

In recent years Persicaria have 
increased in popularity, as gardeners 
realize the value of these plants in a 
range of different situations. Most 
ﬂower profusely for many weeks in 
summer, while those with handsome 
foliage are prized for the beauty of their 
leaves rather than their ﬂowers. Taller 
selections are usually self-supporting, 
while lower-growing types form  
weed-suppressing groundcover. Grow 
Persicaria in moist soil in sun or partial 
shade; P. bistorta tolerates drier soil. 
Aword of warning: some, such as  
P. ‘Red Dragon’, can be invasive and 
need to be kept under control.

Numerous cultivars are available, in colors that include  
white, pale and dark pink, warm cherry red, clear blue,  
and shades of purple. Many ﬂowers have contrasting white 
throats or are streaked with other colors. Penstemons ﬂower 
proliﬁcally in summer and the display can be prolonged, 
provided the plants are regularly deadheaded. Some taller 
cultivars may need staking. All types thrive in well-drained 
soil, preferably in full sun. Some are not fully hardy, and 
where winters are severe, plants should be overwintered in  
a cold frame. Plants are more likely to survive frost if grown  
in a sheltered spot and mulched in fall. Penstemons are simple 
to propagate, and can easily be raised from cuttings.

size from compact plants that grow 12–15in (30–38cm) tall, 
to large plants that may reach 5ft (1.5m). They form clumps 
of arching, strappy foliage, and ﬂower colors range from 
creamy white, yellow, orange, red, pink, and purple, to 
almost black; some also have bands of contrasting colors 
on the petals. The ﬂower forms are classiﬁed as single, 
double, or spider, and some are fragrant. They thrive in 
most soils, except waterlogged, in sun or shade, but ﬂower 
best when in sun for at least part of the day.

Stalwarts of the summer garden, yarrow (Achillea) are 
easy-to-grow perennials for sunny sites and well-drained 
soils. Taller types are best planted toward the back of 
herbaceous borders, while shorter forms associate well 
with grasses in naturalistic planting schemes. Both selections 
also look at home in mixed beds and gravel gardens. Most 
have ﬂattened ﬂower heads, creating a horizontal plane  
that contrasts well with vertical ﬂower spikes. Available in  
a range of colors, including white, yellow, pink, peach, and 
red, the ﬂowers change color as they age, creating a two-tone 
effect. Many make good cut ﬂowers; some can also be dried.

Of all late-summer, daisy-ﬂowered perennials,  
Helenium are among the most colorful. They have 
become increasingly popular with the rise of naturalistic 
plantings, to which they are well suited, although they 
also add a dramatic note to herbaceous borders. The 
sturdy stems bear shuttlecock-shaped ﬂowers in ﬁery 
tones of red, orange, and yellow that last for many weeks. 
Plants seldom need staking and form slowly spreading 
clumps if grown in sun and fertile soil. To lengthen the 
ﬂowering season, select a variety of forms, and cut back 
some in early summer to promote later ﬂowering.

Invaluable border plants, Michaelmas daisies (Aster species 
and cultivars; mostly A. novae-angliae and A. novi-belgii) 
ﬂower later than many other perennials and continue the 
display until late fall. The smaller-ﬂowered species and 
selections associate well with grasses and naturalistic 
planting schemes, while the larger ﬂowers are excellent  
for cutting. The daisylike, single or double ﬂowers range  
in color from white, pink, and red, to purple and blue. 
Michaelmas daisies thrive in sun or partial shade and  
well-drained soil, and tall cultivars may need staking. For 
large ﬂowers, pinch out weaker shoots in spring; to produce 
bushier plants with a greater number of smaller ﬂowers, 
pinch out the top 1–2in (2.5–5cm) of all shoots in late spring.

The genus is quite diverse, with plants 
in a range of sizes and ﬂower colors, 
including white, true blue, purple, pink, 
and red. A few, such as S. argentea, are 
also grown for their foliage, which in 
many species is aromatic. Salvias thrive 
in hot, sunny sites and free-draining 
soil, and grow quickly, many developing 
into shrublike plants within a season. To 
ensure that they survive cold winters, in 
fall spread thick mulch over the plants 
to protect the roots.

forms of R. hirta are small and compact, ideal for the front of 
beds or containers, while others, like R. ‘Herbstonne’, tower 
above the rest, reaching up to 8ft (2.5m) in height. R. maxima 
also has attractive glaucous blue foliage. All types produce 
large ﬂowers on sturdy stems that seldom need staking, and 
the blooms also attract beneﬁcial insects. Rudbeckia thrive 
in an open, sunny situation, and moist but free-draining soil.

Florist’s chrysanthemums, as well as those that are grown as hardy garden  
plants, are grouped according to their differing ﬂower forms, approximate 
ﬂowering season (early, mid- or late fall), and habit. The best groups for  
garden decoration are the sprays, pompons, and semi-pompons, the hardy  
Korean, and early, reﬂexed chrysanthemums. The dwarf Charm-types, forming 
dense, domed masses of ﬂowers, are most attractive displayed in pots for both 
indoor and outdoor use in fall. Most of the various ﬂower forms are described 
below, with further details provided in the Plant Dictionary under Chrysanthemum.
Incurved—fully double, 
dense, spherical ﬂowers 
have incurved petals 
arising from the base  
of the ﬂower and closing 
tightly over the crown.
Pompon—fully double, 
dense, spherical,  
or occasionally 
hemispherical, ﬂowers, 
have tubular petals 
with ﬂat, rounded tips, 
growing outward  
from the crown.Single—ﬂowers each 
have about 5 rows of ﬂat 
petals, borne at right 
angles to the stem, that 
may incurve or reﬂex at 
the tips; the prominent 
central disk is golden 
throughout or has a  
small, green center.
Fully reﬂexed—fully 
double ﬂowers have 
curved, pointed petals 
reﬂexing outward and 
downward from the 
crown and back to touch  
the stem.
Spoon-type—ﬂowers 
are similar to those of 
single forms except  
that the ray petals are 
tubular and open out  
at their tips to form  
a spoon shape. Reﬂexed—fully double 
ﬂowers are similar to 
those of fully reﬂexed 
forms except that the 
petals are less strongly 
reﬂexed and form  
an umbrella-like or  
spiky outline.
Spider-form—double 
ﬂower heads with long, 
thin ray-ﬂorets; the 
outer ray-ﬂorets are 
more or less pendent, 
the inner ones  
curling upward.Intermediate—fully 
double, roughly  
spherical ﬂowers have 
loosely incurving petals, 
which may close at the 
crown or may reﬂex  
for the bottom half of  
each ﬂower.
Quill-shaped—double 
ﬂower heads with 
tubular ray-ﬂorets that 
open out at their tips  
to form spoon shapes.Anemone-centered—
single ﬂowers each have 
a central, dome-shaped 
disk, up to half the 
diameter of the bloom, 
and up to 5 rows of ﬂat, 
or occasionally spoon- 
type, ray petals at right 
angles to the stem.

Candelabra, Auricula, and Primrose-Polyanthus primulas  
are the most widely grown. Auriculas are compact evergreen 
plants with leathery leaves and ﬂowers with beautiful 
markings; they grow well in moist but well-drained soil. 
Candelabras prefer damp soil, and are taller and deciduous, 
with ﬂowers arranged in rings up sturdy stems. The Primrose-
Polyanthus group includes a diverse range of small winter-  
to spring-ﬂowering plants, often sold as bedding or for 
containers, that thrive in moist soil. Most prefer some  
shade. For full cultivation details, see the Plant Dictionary.

Invaluable shade-loving perennials, 
lungworts (Pulmonaria) produce 
clusters of bell-shaped spring ﬂowers 
and hairy, groundcovering foliage. 
Selections are available in a range  
of colors, from white through to  
pink, blue, and purple; P. rubra has red 
blooms. Some cultivars have also been 
selected for the beauty of their foliage, 
which may be spotted or streaked with 
white or silver or variegated. Easy to 
grow, lungworts thrive in cool areas  
in soil that does not dry out. During 
summer, trim off the old foliage and 
fresh leaves, often more prominently 
marked, will soon appear.

Although perhaps best known for providing excellent, 
long-lasting cut ﬂowers, carnations and pinks (Dianthus 
cultivars) are highly ornamental border subjects, valued  
for their usually fragrant, clove-scented blooms, produced 
over a long period in summer, and their distinctive silvery-  
or gray-green foliage. Shorter-growing cultivars—the 
old-fashioned and modern pinks—make excellent edging 
plants. Many of the ﬂowers are attractively marked or have 
fringed petals. Carnations and pinks need an open, sunny 
position, preferably in alkaline soil. All except the perpetual-
ﬂowering carnations are frost-hardy, and most can be easily 
propagated from cuttings. The myriad of carnation and 
pinks cultivars are divided into the following groups:
Border carnations—plants are of upright habit and ﬂower 
proliﬁcally in mid-summer in a single ﬂush; each stem bears 
5 or more ﬂowers. Picotee-ﬂowered forms, with petals 
outlined in a darker, contrasting color, are available.  
 
Perpetual-ﬂowering carnations—similar in habit to 
border carnations, they are usually grown for cut ﬂowers 
and bloom year-round under glass. Plants are normally 
disbudded, leaving one ﬂower per stem, but spray forms 
have up to 5 ﬂowers per stem.  
Malmaison carnations—these produce intensely fragrant 
ﬂowers sporadically throughout the year under glass.
 
Old-fashioned pinks—these have a low, spreading habit 
and form neat cushions of foliage; masses of fragrant  
ﬂowers are produced in mid-summer. Good for border 
edging and cutting.
 
Modern pinks—usually more vigorous than old-fashioned 
pinks, they are repeat-ﬂowering and produce 2 or 3 main 
ﬂushes of ﬂowers in summer. Cut or deadhead to encourage 
further ﬂowering.  
Alpine pinks—in early summer, these plants form cushions 
of small, scented ﬂowers. Good for edging, or in a rock 
garden, raised bed, trough, or alpine house.

Their luxuriant foliage and attractive habit have made hostas, 
or plantain lilies, increasingly sought after as garden plants. 
Native to Asia, they add an exotic touch to watersides or  
damp, shady corners, and large patio containers. Hostas vary 
in size from plants a few inches in height, to tall forms that 
make clumps up to 5ft (1.5m) across. Their elegant, deciduous 
leaves appear in mid-spring and are incredibly diverse in 
shape, texture, and color, with dramatic variegations and 
shadings. Many produce decorative ﬂower spikes, which rise 
gracefully above the foliage in mid-summer and may be 
scented, according to variety. Although hostas are essentially 
shade- and moisture-loving plants, preferring rich, well-
drained soil, they also tolerate drier soil. Protect the leaves 
from slug damage.

With ﬂeshy, drought-resistant foliage and heads of tiny, star-
shaped ﬂowers from summer to fall, Sedum are useful perennials 
for herbaceous borders and gravel gardens, while their nectar- 
rich blooms also make them a good choice for wildlife and 
naturalistic schemes. The ﬂowers of the taller herbaceous plants 
are mostly in shades of pink and red, although white and yellow 
blooms are also available. Many have purple-tinged or variegated 
foliage, which extends their season of interest; the faded ﬂowers 
and seed heads also provide a colorful display in late fall and 
winter. Plants thrive in full sun and free-draining soil, and will  
bulk up quickly. Divide them regularly to prevent clumps from 
ﬂopping open, and stake taller varieties. Protect young growth 
from slugs in spring and early summer.

Helleborus x hybridus (lenten roses) are 
the hybrids between H. orientalis and 
other species. They ﬂower in winter and 
spring, and are so varied that they’re 
often sold by description or collection, 
rather than as named varieties. Their 
single or double ﬂowers last for a few 
months and open in a range of whites, 
yellows, pinks, and purples, often 
spotted or with darker edges. Most are 
evergreen, with large, toothed, divided 
leaves, and prefer moist, neutral to 
alkaline soil, but need protection from 
strong, winter winds. They will naturally 
hybridize and self-seed, and it’s worth 
allowing your own seedlings to develop.

Once regarded as a useful cottage-garden groundcovering 
perennial, grown for its sprays of red ﬂowers and evergreen 
foliage, the selections of Heuchera bred in recent years have 
transformed this humble plant into a horticultural superstar.  
The leaves come in many colors, from near black and purple  
to pink, peach, and yellow-green, and plants are ideal for  
containers as well as borders. Selections of x Heucherella, a 
cross between Heuchera and Tiarella, are smaller and more 
dainty. Plant all types in moist but well-drained soil and 
partial shade, but site brighter-leaved cultivars in a sunnier 
position. Most plants should be split and replanted every  
few years to prevent the crown from becoming woody and  
to keep them in good health.

 ANNUALS, 
BIENNIALS,  
AND BEDDING
Invaluable for their rapid growth, instant color, and relatively 
low cost, annuals and biennials are ideal gap fillers between 
newly planted trees and shrubs, as well as in perennial displays 
that might need reviving after the first flush of spring. They are 
also useful as bedding in formal designs, such as parterres,  
and in containers of all types. An important ingredient  
in cottage gardens and wildflower meadows, they also  
help to shape informal schemes.

plants flower from early summer to early fall, and some also provide 
beautiful foliage. Combine them with plants that bloom in winter and 
spring to brighten up your garden all year.ANNUALS, BIENNIALS, 
AND BEDDING
BELOW Summer harmonies
Combine the shapes and colors of annuals for a 
balanced display. Begonias, heliotropes, silver-leaved 
senecio, and zinnias create a vibrant mix.ABOVE Shades of pink
Create an elegant basket using shades of pink. Dark 
cherry pink petunias, pale busy Lizzies, starry isotomas, 
and raspberry-colored diascias combine beautifully.What are annuals  
and biennials?
Annuals are plants that grow, bloom, set 
seed, and die in a single growing season. 
Biennials complete their life cycle in two 
seasons: most are sown in late spring or 
summer and produce leafy growth in the 
first year, then flower, set seed, and die  
in the next. Bedding plants usually refer  
to half-hardy or tender annuals that are 
traditionally used in summer flower 
schemes. Some plants in this category are 
technically perennials or even shrubs, but 
are referred to as annuals because they are 
used for just one season. Examples include 
pelargoniums, nemesias, and brachyscome, 
which are perennials, and marguerites 
(Argyranthemum species) and fuchsias, 
which are tender shrubs. Plants in this 
group are also sometimes described as 
“summer seasonals” and “spring seasonals.”Growing annuals  
and biennials
Plants in this category can be grown from 
seed, bought as young seedlings known  
as “plug” plants, or purchased as mature 
specimens ready to plant. 
  Sowing seed is the most cost-effective 
option if you have a large space or lots of 
containers to fill; there are many half-hardy 
or frost-tender types that are very easy to 
grow in pots or trays on a windowsill or in 
a greenhouse, including petunias, French 
marigolds (Tagetes), and tobacco plants 
(Nicotiana). The seedlings should be 
hardened off for a few weeks in spring by 
placing them outside during the day and 
bringing them back under cover at night. 
Then plant them outside in late spring  
when all danger of frost has passed. 
  Hardy annuals are easier still, as they can 
be sown outside in spring where they are  
to flower. For earlier summer blooms, 
plants like love-in-a-mist (Nigella) and 
poppies (Papaver rhoeas) can be sown in 
early fall in free-draining soil. Sow your seeds in straight lines or curves, so that you 
can distinguish them from weed seedlings 
when they germinate. 
  For winter and spring color, most suitable 
plants, such as violas, are raised from seed 
sown in summer. Alternatively, buy young 
plants in the fall. 
  Biennials can be grown from seed or 
bought as plug plants in the summer before 
they bloom. Find a quiet corner of the 
garden to sow your seeds, as they will  
be there for many months, and may be 
swamped by other plants if sown directly  
into a summer bed or border. 
Ornamental features
Annuals and biennials are available in a 
wide range of shapes and sizes, from low 
hummock-forming cultivars of Ageratum 
houstonianum and trailing petunias to the 
tall spires of foxgloves (Digitalis purpurea) 
and dramatic Scotch thistles (Onopordum 
acanthium) that shoot up to 6ft (1.8m). 
  Flowers offer a vast choice of colors 
and forms, including scented types such  
as heliotropes (Heliotropium arborescens), 
tobacco plants (Nicotiana species), and the 
chocolate-scented Cosmos atrosanguineus. 
Colors extend from the opalescent whites  
of Lavatera trimestris ‘Mont Blanc’ to the 
vibrant scarlets of pelargoniums, bright 
orange and yellow California poppies 
(Eschscholzia californica), and intense 
magentas and purples of petunias. 
For more subtle pastel schemes, opt for 
plants such as Anoda cristata, blue Silene 
 297/asmall/nsmall/nsmall/usmall/asmall/lsmall/ssmall, /bsmall/ismall/esmall/nsmall/nsmall/ismall/asmall/lsmall/ssmall,  /asmall/nsmall/dsmall /bsmall/esmall/dsmall/dsmall/ismall/nsmall/gsmall
Growing summer bedding plants from seed can be very cost-eﬀective, 
especially if you have several containers or beds to ﬁll. Sowing seed  
in trays indoors is the ideal option for half-hardy or frost-tender plants, 
allowing you to start them oﬀ early in spring so that plants are mature  and ready to ﬂower when planted outside. Small seeds, such as petunias,  
are diﬃcult to space evenly in trays; seedlings will need to be transplanted 
when they have a few leaves to larger trays, pots, or modules. Seed 
catalogs oﬀer a huge variety of plants via mail order or online. 
2 Sow seeds
Pour some seeds into your hand 
and carefully space them out on the 
soil surface. Sprinkle sifted seed-
starting mix over the seeds, and cover  
to the depth speciﬁed on the seed 
packet. Also check the seeds’ required 
germination temperature.1 Fill seed trays
Using good-quality seed-starting 
mix, ﬁll some clean seed trays to 
within 1in (2cm) of the top. Gently 
press another seed tray on top to  
level out and ﬁrm the surface. Water  
the tray with a watering can with a  
ﬁne spray and allow to drain. 
Pot of seed-sown annuals 3 Cover and keep moist
Label the seed tray, and cover 
with a lid or a clear plastic bag. Place 
in a light spot. Keep the soil moist, 
and remove the lid or plastic bag  
as soon as the seedlings emerge. 
Harden them oﬀ before planting  
them outside.2 Plant up modules
Make a hole in the potting mix 
with your ﬁnger or the pencil and 
insert a plug into each module 
orpot. Firm the soil around the 
plants with your ﬁngers, ensuring 
that there are no air gaps and 
taking care not to compact the 
soil or damage the roots. 1 Remove plugs
Water the plugs as soon as 
they arrive. Fill large cell trays 
or3in (8cm) pots with good- 
quality potting mix designed for 
seedlings. Use the blunt end of  
a pencil to gently push them out 
of their original containers from 
the bottom.3 Water the plants
Using a watering can with 
aﬁne spray, water the plugs  
well. Set them in a cool, light, 
frost-free place and keep them 
well watered. Harden the young 
plants oﬀ before planting them 
outside after the risk of frost  
has passed.POTTING PLUG PLANTS
If you lack the space or time to sow seed, look for seedlings grown in cell packs, 
known as “plugs.” Many popular plants, including busy Lizzies, begonias, lobelias, and 
fuchsias, are available in this form, with the largest choice available from mail-order 
specialists. Pot up small plugs and grow them on indoors until after the last frost.
SOWING SEED IN TRAYScoeli-rosa, baby blue eyes (Nemophila 
menziesii), and pale green blooms of 
Nicotiana langsdorffii. 
To provide a foil for the flowers, consider 
the wealth of foliage plants available.  
These include the vast variety of coleus 
(Solenostemon) with their multicolored 
leaves, the bright silver foliage of Senecio 
cineraria, and the dark purple-lobed leaves 
of Ipomoea batatus ‘Blackie’. 
Design options
Annuals and biennials provide an extended 
season of color in formal schemes, and are 
particularly useful for filling beds and gaps 
in borders. In addition, they can be used to 
edge flower beds and borders or to create 
Victorian-style bedding schemes, which are 
enjoying renewed popularity. 
Hardy annuals like poppies, cornflowers 
(Centaurea), and California bluebell 
(Phacelia campanularia) are ideal for 
naturalistic or wildlife schemes. For mixed 
schemes, grow them in pots like half-hardy 
annuals or buy plug plants and set them 
between more permanent perennials  
and shrubs (many annual seeds will not 
germinate in these situations due to 
competition from neighboring plants). 
Annuals and bedding plants make 
striking features in seasonal containers, 
windowboxes, and hanging baskets. Use 
feature plants, such as fuchsias, zinnias, 
and begonias in the center, together with 
trailers like Helichrysum petiolatum or 
trailing petunias to soften the edges of  
your pots. In fall and winter displays, combine dwarf conifers, such as Juniperus 
communis ‘Compressa’, with dainty violas.
Year-round color
The long flowering season of annuals and 
biennials provides months of color. Violas 
flower in winter but put on their best show 
in spring, when they are joined by forget-
me-nots (Myosotis) and wallflowers 
(Erysimum cheiri), which look particularly beautiful when combined with bulbs such 
as daffodils and tulips. Follow these with 
any of the summer annuals and biennials, 
such as foxgloves (Digitalis). Busy Lizzies 
(Impatiens) are particularly useful for shady 
sites. Fall stars include Chinese asters 
(Callistephus chinensis), and in warm climes, 
the fruits of Solanum pseudocapsicum will 
brighten a winter day. In cold areas, bring 
these bushy evergreens indoors.

Flowering freely all summer and throughout early fall  
until the ﬁrst frost, fuchsias make excellent container and 
border plants. The single or double blooms vary from small 
and dainty to bold and frilly, their colorful outer sepals held 
above petals in similar or contrasting hues. A few also boast 
variegated foliage. Ranging in habit from strongly upright, 
through broad and bushy, to arching and trailing, there are 
fuchsias for many garden situations. Upright and bushy 
types inject summer color into permanent mixed border 
schemes or seasonal bedding displays, while larger types 
make good container specimens, combining well with  
other summer ﬂowers. Trailing fuchsias are ideal for 
hanging baskets and windowboxes.

Pelargoniums are perfect for containers and beds, and ﬂower 
almost continuously in warm climates or under glass. Most  
fall into one of four main groups. Zonal geraniums have 
rounded leaves, clearly marked with a darker “zone,” and 
single to double ﬂowers. Regal types are shrubby with 
serrated leaves and delicate, trumpet-shaped ﬂowers. Ivy-
leaved pelargoniums are trailing plants with lobed leaves and 
single to double ﬂowers—a good choice for hanging baskets. 
Scented-leaved types and species have small, star-shaped 
ﬂowers and are grown principally for their fragrant foliage. 
Unique types are tall subshrubs with regal, brightly colored 
ﬂowers; some also have scented leaves. To ﬂower well, all 
types need sun and well-drained soil.

The genus Begonia is one of the most versatile, providing 
interest throughout the year. Semperﬂorens begonias are 
excellent for summer bedding, while the Rex-cultorum 
group offers distinctive, handsome foliage in a huge variety 
of decorative shades and unusual textures. Other begonias, 
such as the Tuberhybrida cultivars with their large, showy 
blooms, are grown mostly for their ﬂowers. Most begonias 
are not suitable for permanent outdoor cultivation in 
frost-prone areas as they are not hardy, but they make 
attractive houseplants and displays in summer containers. 
Begonias may be ﬁbrous-rooted, rhizomatous, or tuberous, 
the tubers becoming dormant in winter. Grow them in  
a light position, shaded from direct sun.

 ROCK PLANTS
Rock plants are prized for their natural charm, foliage forms, 
and, in many cases, masses of colorful flowers in spring and 
summer. Grow them in areas that mimic the conditions in which 
they thrive in the wild, which are usually exposed sites with 
stony, rapidly draining soils. As long as they have sharp 
drainage and protection from excessive winter moisture, you  
can grow rock plants in small gardens in a trough or container, 
or where there is more space, in a rock garden or scree bed. If 
the soil in your garden is unsuitable, you can also grow these 
ground-hugging plants in raised beds to create landscapes in 
miniature. Raised beds also have the advantage of bringing  
the small plants closer to eye level so that you can admire  
their tiny, delicate features in more detail.
330
The delicate flowers and foliage of many rock plants belies their tough 
nature, withstanding the burning sun and harsh winds typical of their 
alpine habitats. They make excellent plants for the garden, and are 
perfect for rock and scree gardens, wall crevices, troughs, and pots. ROCK PLANTS
ABOVE Mediterranean mountains
Recreate a Mediterranean alpine scene with clay  
pots and pebbles decorating beds that include a  
range of sedums, saxifrages, thymes, and arabis,  
with clipped boxwood balls providing structure.

Siting a rock garden on a gentle slope assists rapid 
drainage, while an open, sunny site is perfect for alpines. 
Choose plants with contrasting forms, such as teardrop-
shaped, upright conifers and mats of colorful blooms./rsmall/osmall/csmall/ksmall /psmall/lsmall/asmall/nsmall/tsmall/ssmallThese adaptations help them survive the 
drying, high-velocity winds, brilliant, 
burning sun, and extreme temperature 
fluctuations of their natural habitats. 
Most rock plants grow in areas that  
have stony soil with rapid drainage,  
which explains why few can cope with wet 
soil around the roots, which is experienced 
at lower altitudes. They also dislike warm, 
humid summers. 
In the wild, high-growing species are 
insulated from winter cold by a blanket of 
snow, beneath which they remain dormant 
at temperatures around 32°F (0°C) until 
spring. Those environments that mimic 
conditions in the wild, such as rock 
gardens, scree and gravel beds, troughs, 
pots, raised beds, and open frames, are 
therefore ideal for growing rock plants. You 
can grow alpines successfully even in areas 
where the soil is unsuitable by filling raised 
beds, pots, and troughs with free-draining 
soil and horticultural grit.Designing with  rock plants
One of the major attractions of this  
group is their diminutive size, which 
allows you to grow a huge number of 
different plant types in a relatively 
confined space. 
In a rock garden—as in larger-scale 
plantings—use small shrubs, such as  
the highly fragrant Daphne cneorum 
and D. retusa or the catkin-bearing Salix 
bockii and S. apoda, to form the structural 
framework of your design. Miniature 
conifers, such as Juniperus communis 
‘Compressa’, provide vertical accents  
and year-round color, and work well in 
combination with the contrasting forms  
of rounded or domed plants, such as the 
evergreen Hebe cupressoides ‘Boughton 
Dome’ and Cassiope lycopodioides.
This structure can then be filled in with 
mat- and cushion-forming plants, such as 
sandworts (Arenaria) or Dianthus deltoides, What are rock plants?
The term rock plants includes bulbs and 
mat- and cushion-forming perennials—
many of which are evergreen—as well as 
dwarf conifers and both evergreen and 
deciduous shrubs. Some are true alpines 
from mountain regions, while others are 
simply compact plants suitable for rock-
garden planting schemes. While some 
alpines have specialized needs, many 
species and cultivars, including aubrietas 
and geraniums, are easy to grow and thrive 
in any well-drained soil and sunny site. 
True alpines are found at high altitudes 
above the tree line on mountains, growing 
on scree slopes, in short sod, or finding 
protection from the wind by squeezing  
into rock crevices. Subalpine plants live 
below the tree line on rocky slopes or in 
high pastures or meadows. Most alpines 
are compact in habit and frequently deep-
rooting, usually with small leaves that  
are leathery, fleshy, or covered in fine hair. Large Medium Small

to cover it. Overlap the edges when 
joining two pieces together. Cut 
crosses where you plan to plant. 
A weed-free gravel garden 2 Plant up
Fold back the ﬂaps, and dig a hole, 
putting the excavated soil on a plastic 
sheet. Insert the plant, water in, and 
backﬁll with soil. Firm in and replace 
the ﬂaps around the plant stems.3  Add gravel mulch
Trim the fabric around the

a 2–3in (5–8cm) layer of gravel over 
the fabric and around each plant. PLANTING A GRAVEL OR SCREE GARDEN

suppressing fabric over the soil ﬁrst. This eliminates light and stops weed 
seeds from germinating but still allows moisture through to the plant.Gravel gardens are ideal for alpines and rock plants. Stones can be worked 
into a scheme to create a rock garden, or a variety of rock and stone sizes 
used on a slope to form a natural scree. A gravel or slate chip mulch helps 
1 Prepare the trough
Cover the drainage holes at the base of the 
trough with crocks. Add a 2in (5cm) layer of gravel. 
Fill up the trough with equal parts of soil-based 
potting mix and sand, to 2in (5cm) from the top.
2  Add slates and plants
Push the slate chips vertically into the medium, 
leaving spaces for the alpines. Water the plants, and 
plant them into the gaps, making sure the roots are 
covered with the sand and soil mix. Water well.PLANTING A SLATE-FILLED TROUGH
Topped with slate chips, this decorative trough 
mirrors a natural mountain scree, and provides  
a long season of color in spring and summer. 
Plants included in this display are 
Draba 
species, erigerons, saxifrages, Silene acaulis 
and 
Townsendia grandiﬂora. However, any 
small alpines that have diﬀerent leaf textures 
and ﬂower colors will work equally well. Move 
your trough to its ﬁnal position before you start, 
as it will be very heavy once planted.at the feet of slightly taller, feathery-leaved 
pulsatillas or the airy Linum narbonense. 
As well as shape and form, think about 
contrasting textures. Candidates include 
the almost beadlike foliage of certain 
sedums, spiky houseleek (Sempervivum) 
rosettes, and the pointy-tipped gray leaves  
of Euphorbia myrsinites, which would make 
eye-catching partners for the white-haired 
leaves of edelweiss (Leontopodium) or the 
silky, silver leaves of celmisias. 
Most alpines like an open sunny site  
and will not thrive if they are shaded by 
overhanging trees or neighboring plants. 
Plant them with space to spread, and use  
a dry mulch, such as gravel, to keep the 
stems and leaves dry at all times. Mulches 
also act as a foil for the plants.
If you have limited space, plant a 
selection of alpines in small pots filled with 
gritty potting mix. Many plants in this 
group are drought-tolerant and thrive in 
containers, and when grouped together 
make colorful displays. Troughs can be 
given a modern makeover by planting 
alpines between slate chips (see box right), 
or using a ground glass or shell mulch.
Raised beds offer another design option 
for those with small gardens. They are also 
useful for people with reduced mobility, 
allowing them to access the plants more 
easily. Use raised beds to create miniature 
landscapes with plants spreading between 
rocks and pebbles. Dry-stone walls offer 
ideal sites for many crevice-lovers, such  
as aubretias and sedums, while cascading 
alpines, such as Saxifraga ‘Tumbling 
Waters’, are perfect for the tops of walls.Year-round interest
Many alpines flower in spring and early 
summer, just after the snow melts and 
before the heat of mid-summer in their 
natural habitat. For color earlier in the  
year, plant spring bulbs, such as alpine 
narcissus or crocuses, among evergreen 
perennials, conifers, and small shrubs. 
The choice of flowers at the peak flowering 
times is vast, so coordinate your color schemes for a dramatic performance. 
Hot colors, such as the bright yellow 
sedums and wallflowers (Erysimum) and 
scarlet and orange helianthemums, create 
highlights against more subdued blues and 
purples. As the summer progresses, select 
later-flowering rock plants, including phlox, 
crepis, and diascias, followed by the pink 
Silene schafta, gentians, and berry-bearing 
gaultherias in the fall.

Although there are gentians large enough to hold their own  
in the herbaceous border, most are low-growing, deciduous or 
evergreen perennials, best suited to rock gardens, where they  
can form spreading mats. Flowering between spring and fall,  
they are renowned for their vivid blue trumpet-shaped ﬂowers, 
which are produced in pale shades, such as G. ‘Strathmore’, to 
intensely dark, such as G. acaulis, although there are also white- 
and yellow-ﬂowered forms. All require a cool position, sheltered 
from hot summer sun. Most need light, rich, moist but well-
drained neutral soil; fall-ﬂowering species and cultivars, such  
as G.sino-ornata, require acidic conditions to thrive. Protect 
from slugs and snails, particularly in spring.

The main attraction of houseleeks (Sempervivum) is their 
colorful rosettes of leaves. These range from bright yellow, 
through various shades of green, gray, pink, purple, red,  
and orange, to almost black. The leaves may be dull or glossy, 
or covered with soft down or longer hairs. Leaf shape can  
also vary from short and succulent to long and tapering. The 
rosettes are most striking in the spring and summer, but even 
in the winter, many varieties remain attractively colored. It is 
the endless range of different leaf shapes, shades, and textures 
that make this group so interesting to enthusiasts. They do not 
like damp or shady conditions, but thrive in well-drained soil 
in full sun. Houseleeks are ideal for pots or sink gardens on  
a south-facing patio, or can be planted out in rock gardens  
or in the crevices of stone walls.

 BULBS
Bulbous plants are found throughout the world in habitats as 
diverse as woodland and scrub, meadows, river banks, the edges 
of streams, and rocky hills and mountains. There are bulbs to suit 
every garden site and design, from the tiny Iris danfordiae for a 
rock garden, to daffodils and tulips in beds and borders, and the 
carpeting erythroniums or statuesque Cardiocrinum giganteum 
for a woodland garden. Most have a distinct flowering season, yet 
with careful planning it is possible to extend or enhance this 
period of interest. Although most bloom in spring or early 
summer, producing splashes of color before many shrubs  
and perennials reach their peak, plant snowdrops for  
late winter color, and colchicums, cyclamen, and some  
crocuses to brighten a fall day.

/bsmall/usmall/lsmall/bsmall/ssmallEmbracing a wide range of decorative plants, bulbs provide exciting 
effects throughout the year, with large drifts of snowdrops in late winter, 
daffodils and tulips in spring, the exquisite perfume of lilies and vibrant 
dahlia colors in summer, and the spidery flowers of nerines in fall.  BULBS
BELOW Carpets of spring color
A selection of daffodils has been naturalized in the 
grass beneath silver birches and spring-flowering  
trees, creating a sea of nodding yellow flowers.What are bulbs?
The term “bulb” can be used to describe all 
swollen, underground, food-storage organs, 
and includes true bulbs as well as corms, 
rhizomes, and tubers. True bulbs have fleshy 
scales—modified leaves or leaf bases—that 
overlap and are often enclosed in a papery 
tunic, as in narcissi, or they may be naked 
and loosely arranged like lily bulbs. 
Corms are compressed and enlarged 
stem bases, usually enclosed in a fibrous or 
papery tunic, as in the crocus. Each corm 
lasts one year, and is replaced by a new one 
after flowering. Tubers, such as cyclamen, 
are solid, underground sections of modified 
stem or root and seldom possess scales or 
tunics. Rhizomes are modified stems that 
creep at or just below soil level, and may be 
thin and wiry or swollen and fleshy. 
A few bulbs are evergreen, but most 
grow and bloom during a short season,  
and then die back to below ground level. 
Their leaves produce the food store for  the following year, which is why the foliage 
must not be cut down after flowering but 
allowed to wither naturally. 
When below ground, bulbs are described 
as dormant, but they are, in fact, ripening 
and developing the following year’s flowers, 
and must be planted in a suitable site to 
thrive. Bulbs that originate from dry, hot 
climates, such as nerines and watsonias, 
need warm, dry conditions when dormant 
to aid ripening and flower formation,  
while those from woodlands or other  
damp, shaded habitats, such as bluebells 
(Hyacinthoides) and snowdrops (Galanthus), 
require a cool, slightly moist spot. 
Designing with bulbs
There are bulbs to suit all garden designs 
and planting styles. They range in size from 
the tiny Iris danfordiae and fall daffodil 
(Sternbergia lutea), both suitable for a scree 
or rock garden, to carpeting erythroniums 
for the dappled shade of a woodland 
garden, midrange alliums and tulips for a 
hot, sunny border, and tall, slender regal 
lilies that produce highly scented flowers 
on stems up to 6ft (1.8m) in height. The Bulbs are divided into smaller plant 
categories, including true bulbs, corms,  
and tubers. All of these swollen, 
underground, food-storage organs help  
the bulb to survive periods of drought. BULB DEFINITIONS
Bulb 
A true bulb is a storage organ made up of  
stems and ﬂeshy leaves inside. Examples 
include daﬀodils, tulips, and eucomis (above).
Corm
Swollen stems that have adapted to store  
food are known as corms. They appear solid 
throughout, and include crocuses (above).
Tuber
Tuberous plants have swollen underground 
roots or stems. Examples include cyclamen, 
dahlias (above), and begonias.Large Medium Small

(75cm) (23–75cm) (23cm)SIZE CATEGORIES USED WITHIN THIS GROUP
 381/bsmall/usmall/lsmall/bsmall/ssmallflower forms also lend themselves to certain 
garden styles. Tulips with sculptural 
cupped flowers planted en masse, and the 
sharp flower shapes of many dahlias, are 
ideal for formal schemes, while the looser 
flower forms of nectaroscordums and 
turkscap lilies, and arching spikes of 
crocosmias create an informal look. Sod 
spangled with crocuses or snake’s-head 
fritillaries (Fritillaria meleagris) mimics 
their wild habitat and provides early  
color in naturalistic schemes.
Bulbs add seasonal color and interest  
to mixed borders with annuals, shrubs, and 
perennials. Daffodils (Narcissus), crown 
imperials (Fritillaria imperialis), alliums, 
and dahlias all blend well with other types 
of plantings. Unscented lilies make good 
partners for scented roses, while exotic-
looking cannas and alstroemerias add spice 
to a tropical design. If you can't squeeze 
bulbs into your border, many are perfectly 
at home in containers and baskets.
Year-round interest
Choose carefully, and you can have a bulb 
in flower for most of the year. The first to 
appear in late winter are the snowdrops 
(Galanthus) and winter aconites (Eranthis), 
while early narcissus, muscari, crocuses, 
scillas, chionodoxas, dwarf iris, and 
Anemone blanda mark the onset of spring.
In mid-spring, fill your garden with 
vibrant yellow daffodils and bright tulips, 
or opt for the same plants in pastel shades—
the choice is vast for both genera. Summer-flowering bulbs, such as Galtonia 
candicans, most alliums, the Peruvian 
daffodil (Hymenocallis narcissiflora), and 
ornithogalums offer colorful highlights.
These are followed in late summer by 
gladioli, crinums, dahlias, and crocosmias, 
which may continue to bloom into the fall 
until the first frost. When the summer

bulbs at garden centers or in mail-order catalogs, and check ﬂowering times  
for a synchronized display of tulips, daﬀodils, and grape hyacinths (Muscari).
2 Cover the bulbs
Now place the next layer  
of bulbs, such as tulips, between 
the daﬀodil bulbs, and cover with 
more potting mix. Finally, add 
small bulbs, like grape hyacinths, 
on this top layer, and cover with 
potting mix. Press down lightly 
with your hands, and leave the 
pot in a sheltered sunny spot.1 Plant in layers
In fall, place crocks at the 
bottom of a large pot and add  
a 2in (5cm) layer of gravel.  
Then add a layer of good-quality 
potting mix. Place the largest 
bulbs—for example, daﬀodils— 
on the surface and cover with 
more potting mix so that the  
tips are just visible.

spectacle is over, select fall-flowering 
nerines, crocuses, colchicums, and 
cyclamen, and to end the year, use 
Cyclamen hederifolium, whose marbled 
foliage often persists into winter. 
For scented bulbs, choose hyacinths, 
bluebells, and scented daffodils for spring, 
and lilies and crinums for summer displays. 
NATURALIZING BULBS
You can create spectacular eﬀects by 
naturalizing bulbs in a lawn or under trees. 
Choose robust plants, such as snowdrops, 
daﬀodils, and crocuses, which are able  
to compete with tree roots and grass. To 
achieve a natural, random eﬀect, toss the 
bulbs in the air and plant them individually 
where they fall. For each bulb, dig out a 
small plug of sod and soil, two to three 
times the depth of the bulb. After ﬂowering, 
when the leaves have died, mow the grass.

Comprising about 180 species, with over 10,000 hybrids  
and cultivars for garden cultivation, exhibiting, and cutting, 
gladioli are prized for their showy spikes of usually open, 
funnel-shaped ﬂowers. Gladiolus hybrids are divided into 
the Grandiﬂorus Group, with long, densely packed ﬂower 
spikes, categorized as miniature, small, medium-sized, 
large, or giant, according to the width of the lowest ﬂowers, 
and the Primulinus and Nanus Groups, which have loose 
spikes of small ﬂowers. Plant gladioli in borders or pots  
for late spring to early fall displays, and store corms in a 
frost-free place over winter. In cold areas, grow them by  
a sheltered, sunny wall; winter-ﬂowering South African 
gladioli require a cool greenhouse. For more information, 
see the Plant Dictionary.

Commonly known as the Peruvian lily, lily of the Incas,  
or parrot lily, these South American tuberous perennials 
are prized for their delicate funnel-shaped blooms in 
yellow, orange, pink, red, white, or purple, with decorative 
markings in contrasting colors. They also have an 
exceptionally long ﬂowering season, from mid-summer  
to the ﬁrst frost, and make excellent cut ﬂowers. Most 
suppliers offer plants, rather than tubers, which are best 
planted in spring after the last frost in a sunny site and 
free-draining soil, giving the roots time to establish  
before winter. Young plants are vulnerable to cold, wet 
conditions—protect them in winter with a thick mulch  
of well-rotted compost or manure.

Lilies (Lilium species and cultivars) make elegant additions 
to summer borders and containers. Their ﬂamboyant ﬂowers 
range from nodding, upright, and trumpet-shaped forms, to 
turkscaps with recurved petals. The blooms are often spotted 
with a darker or contrasting color, or have conspicuous 
stamens. Many lilies have a powerful, sweet fragrance, most 
notably the Oriental and Longiﬂorum hybrids, although a 
few species are unpleasantly scented. The hybrids thrive  
in sun and well-drained soil, and are available in a dazzling 
array of colors, from white, pink, and red, to shades of 
yellow and orange. Lily species prefer partially-shaded sites; 
some also require acidic soil. Leave plants undisturbed once 
established, as the bulbs are easily damaged. For more 
information, see the Plant Dictionary.

Grown as much for their dramatic foliage as for their 
ﬂamboyant ﬂowers, cannas are ideal for lush tropical 
planting schemes, as an accent plant in a border, or as  
a bold addition to container displays. Large paddle- or 
broadly lance-shaped leaves are produced in a range of 
colors, from green to dark maroon, and many are striped 
or variegated, while the vibrant red, orange, or yellow 
ﬂowers bloom for many months from summer to early fall. 
Plant these tender South American rhizomatic perennials 
after the last frost in spring in fertile soil and full sun—they 
require heat to ﬂower well. In fall, cut down the stems and 
leaves when frost blackens the foliage, and store the 
rhizomes in a frost-free place over winter.

The wide spectrum of dahlia hybrids offers a bold display of color and form  
from summer to the ﬁrst frosts of fall. Flower colors range from deep red, 
crimson, purple, mauve, and vibrant pink, to white, apricot, orange, bronze,  
and bright scarlet, while the blooms range from tiny 2-in (5-cm) pompons to  
huge exhibition blooms more than 10in (25cm) across. 
Dahlias ﬂower proliﬁcally—in the right conditions, a single plant may produce 
up to 100 blooms. They make beautiful border plants, compact types are ideal  
for containers, and all are good for cutting. In addition, no special skills are 
required to grow them, but protect the tubers from frost. The ﬂower types  
below indicate the recognized groups.
Single—ﬂowers usually 
have 8–10 broad petals 
surrounding an open, 
central disk.
Anemone—fully double 
ﬂowers each with one or 
more rings of ﬂattened  
ray petals surrounding  
a dense group of shorter, 
tubular petals, usually 
longer than petals of 
single dahlias.
Collarette—single 
ﬂowers with 8–10 broad, 
outer petals, and an inner 
“collar” of smaller petals 
surrounding an open, 
central disk. 
Water-lily—fully double 
ﬂowers with large, 
generally sparse ray 
petals, which are ﬂat or 
with slightly incurved  
or recurved margins, 
giving the ﬂower a  
ﬂat appearance.
Decorative—fully double 
ﬂowers with no visible 
central disk, and broad, 
ﬂat petals, sometimes 
twisted, that incurve 
slightly at their margins.Ball—spherical, fully 
double ﬂowers, sometimes 
slightly ﬂattened on top, 
with densely packed, 
almost tubular, petals.
Pompon—a miniature 
form of ball ﬂowers, but 
more spherical in shape, 
with fully double ﬂowers 
no more than 2in (5cm) 
in diameter.
Cactus—fully double 
ﬂowers have narrow, 
pointed petals that can be 
straight or curl inward 
and have recurved edges 
for more than two-thirds 
of their length.
Semi-cactus—fully 
double ﬂowers similar  
to cactus types, but with 
broader-based petals,  
the edges of which are 
generally recurved  
toward their tips.
Miscellaneous—ﬂowers 
that fall into a wide range 
of unclassiﬁed types, 
including peony-like 
(shown right), single,  
and double forms.

Tulips are excellent in the rock garden, in formal bedding,  
as elegant cut ﬂowers, and for containers. Their bold ﬂowers 
are generally simple in outline and held upright, often with 
bright, strong colors. Many of the species deserve to be  
more widely grown alongside the large variety of hybrids 
currently available. Tulipa is classiﬁed in 15 divisions, which 
are described below. 
Div. 1 Single early—cup-shaped, single ﬂowers, often opening 
wide in sun, are borne from early to mid-spring.
Div. 2 Double early—long-lasting, double ﬂowers open wide in 
early and mid-spring. 
Div. 3 Triumph—sturdy stems bear rather conical, single ﬂowers, 
becoming more rounded, in mid- and late spring.
Div. 4 Darwin hybrids—large, single ﬂowers are borne on strong 
stems from mid- to late spring. 
Div. 5 Single late—single ﬂowers, usually with pointed petals, 
are borne in late spring and very early summer. 
Div. 6 Lily-ﬂowered—strong stems bear narrow-waisted, single 
ﬂowers, with long, pointed, often reﬂexed petals, in late spring.
Div. 7 Fringed—ﬂowers are similar to those in Div. 6, but have 
fringed petals.
Div. 8 Viridiﬂora—variable, single ﬂowers, with partly greenish 
petals, are borne in late spring. 
Div. 9 Rembrandt—ﬂowers are similar to those in Div. 6, but have 
striped or feathered patterns caused by viruses, and appear in late spring.
Div. 10 Parrot—has large, variable, single ﬂowers, with frilled or fringed 
and usually twisted petals, in late spring.
Div. 11 Double late (peony-ﬂowered—usually bowl-shaped, double 
ﬂowers appear in late spring.
Div. 12 Kaufmanniana hybrids—single ﬂowers are usually bicolored, 
open ﬂat in sun and appear in early spring; leaves often mottled or striped. 
Div. 13 Fosteriana hybrids—large, single ﬂowers open wide in the 
sun from early to mid-spring. Leaves are often mottled or striped.
Div. 14 Greigii hybrids—large, single ﬂowers appear in mid- and 
late spring. Mottled or striped leaves are often wavy-edged.

Narcissus species and hybrids grace the garden from early to late spring 
with diverse ﬂowers, ranging from the tiny Cyclamineus types, with their  
swept-back petals, to the stately trumpet daffodils. Some are also scented, 
including the Poeticus, Jonquilla, and many of the small-ﬂowered forms.  
Daffodils can be naturalized to form a carpet in grass or a wild garden,  
or used to brighten up beds and borders, but dwarf forms are best in  
rock or gravel gardens, or planted in pots and troughs. 
The genus is classiﬁed in 13 divisions. Their ﬂower forms are illustrated  
below, with the exception of Div. 12, miscellaneous, and Div. 13, which  
comprise mostly wild species. Both have varying ﬂowers, including hoop- 
petticoat forms, and are produced between fall and early summer.
Div. 1 Trumpet—usually 
solitary ﬂowers, each with  
a trumpet that is as long  
as, or longer than, the  
petals. Early to late 
spring-ﬂowering.
Div. 2 Large-cupped—
solitary ﬂowers, each  
with a cup at least one- 
third the length of, but 
shorter than, the petals. 
Spring-ﬂowering.
Div. 3 Small-cupped—
ﬂowers are often borne 
singly, each with a cup  
not more than one-third  
the length of the petals.
Spring- or early  
summer-ﬂowering. Div. 7 Jonquilla and 
Apodanthus—sweetly 
scented ﬂowers, usually  
1–5 per stem. Cups are 
short, sometimes ﬂanged; 
petals are often ﬂat, fairly 
broad, and rounded. Mid-  
to late spring-ﬂowering.
Div. 8 Tazetta—clusters 
of 12 or more small, fragrant 
ﬂowers per stem, or 3 or 4 
large ones. Cups are small 
and often straight-sided; 
petals are broad and mostly 
pointed. Late autumn- to 
mid-spring-ﬂowering. 
Div. 4 Double—most 
have solitary large, fully or 
semi-double ﬂowers with  
the cup and petals, or just 
the cup, replaced by petaloid 
structures. Some have 
smaller ﬂowers in clusters  
of 4 or more. Spring- or 
early summer-ﬂowering.
Div. 11 Split-cupped— 
usually solitary ﬂowers  
with cups split along more 
than half their length. 
Spring-ﬂowering.
(a) Collar—wide cup 
segments lie back on  
the petals.
(b) Papillon—narrower  
cup segments have tips 
arranged at the margin  
of the petals.Div. 5 Triandrus—
2–6 nodding ﬂowers per 
stem, each with a short, 
sometimes straight-sided 
cup and narrow, reﬂexed 
petals. Spring-ﬂowering. 
Div. 6 Cyclamineus—
usually 1 or 2 ﬂowers per 
stem with cups that are 
sometimes ﬂanged and often 
longer than those of Div.5. 
Petals are narrow, pointed, 
and reﬂexed. Early to 
mid-spring ﬂowering.Div. 9 Poeticus—1–2 
ﬂowers per stem, each  
with a small, colored cup 
and glistening white petals. 
Most are sweetly scented. 
Late spring- or early 
summer-ﬂowering.
Div. 10 Bulbocodium—
ﬂowers usually borne  
singly on very short  
stems, with insigniﬁcant 
petals and large, widely 
ﬂaring cups. Winter- to 
spring-ﬂowering.

Cormous perennials with ﬂowers in vibrant shades  
of yellow, orange, and red, and sword-shaped, pleated 
foliage, crocosmias are real crowd-pleasers. The ﬂowers 
are held on elegant arching stems and bloom for many 
weeks between mid-summer and fall. Most are easy to 
grow, spreading quickly when conditions are right for 
them. Plants, rather than corms, are the best choice for 
beginners, and should be planted in spring in moist but 
well-drained fertile soil in sun or partial shade. Those  
that are borderline hardy will beneﬁt from a warm site 
near a protective wall.

Crocus species and cultivars are versatile dwarf bulbous 
plants. Most ﬂower in late winter or early spring; a few 
bloom in fall. Colors range from white, cream, and yellow to 
pinkish-lilac and purple, and many are attractively striped or 
feathered with other colors. The goblet-shaped ﬂowers open 
wide in full sun, in some cases revealing contrasting centers 
or conspicuous stamens. Most crocuses are also fragrant. 
Plant in rock or gravel gardens with other early ﬂowering 
dwarf bulbs or perennials, in drifts in grass, or beneath 
deciduous trees and shrubs, where they will rapidly spread. 
If naturalized in grass, delay mowing until the leaves have 
died down. Feed with an all-purpose granular fertilizer once 
the ﬂowers have faded.

 WATER AND 
BOG PLANTS
The sound and reflective qualities of water have long been used 
to animate garden designs, and whether tiny or large, formal or 
informal, every garden has space for a water feature. A pond, 
pool, or container also greatly extends the range of plants that 
you can grow. They are classified according to the depth of water 
required for them to thrive, and include deep-water aquatics, 
marginal plants, and moisture-lovers or bog plants. Together, 
they offer a succession of interest, providing a diversity of 
foliage, form, and flower color. Informal ponds with sloping  
sides and richly planted banks will also attract a wide range  
of wildlife, including frogs, toads, and birds.
432Still or moving water reflects light and adds a dynamic quality to garden 
designs. It also greatly extends the range of plants that you can grow, 
with aquatic and moisture-loving types injecting color, texture, and  
form into water features. They also provide excellent wildlife habitat. WATER AND BOG PLANTS
/wsmall/asmall/tsmall/esmall/rsmall /asmall/nsmall/dsmall /bsmall/osmall/gsmall /psmall/lsmall/asmall/nsmall/tsmall/ssmall ABOVE Patio feature
Tiny but perfectly formed, this patio water feature, 
fringed by ferns, supports flowering irises and arum 
lilies. Flow from a pump helps to oxygenate the water.What are water plants?
The broad definition of water plants 
includes all plants that grow rooted, 
submerged, or floating in water. They  
are further subdivided into deep-water 
aquatics, surface- or free-floating plants, 
marginals, and bog or moisture-loving 
plants, depending on the depth of water 
they require.
Water plants are grown for their beauty 
and ornamental value, but when a wide 
range of plants are grown together, they 
also create a healthy ecosystem that 
maintains the quality of the water in a 
feature or pond. A balanced range of plants 
will regulate the levels of light, oxygen, and 
nutrients, helping to keep the water clear. 
Submerged plants like hornwort 
(Ceratophyllum demersum) are known 
as “oxygenators.” These purify the water  
by using up nutrients and excluding light, 
which prevents algal growth. Surface-
floaters, such as water hyacinths (Eichhornia 
crassipes), also absorb dissolved nutrients. 
Deep-water plants, including water lilies 
(Nymphaea), root at the bottom of ponds, 
while their flowers and leaves shade the 
surface, again helping to prevent the growth 
of algae. The roots of marginal plants are 
submerged, but their top growth is visible 
above the water, providing shelter for fish, 
amphibians, and other wildlife.
Ornamental planting
To maximize the planting potential of  
your pond, create areas at varying depths 
to accommodate different types. Begin 
planting at the center of your pond, using 
deep-water plants, such as Cape pondweed 
(Aponogeton distachyos) with its white 
flowers that pop up at the surface, and the 
floating water soldier (Stratiotes aloides), 
which has spiky leaves; both require a 
depth of about 24–36in (60–90cm). (See  box below for details on plant depths.)  
Most water lilies need to root at depths  
of 12–36in (30–100cm), depending on the 
species or cultivar. Dwarf water lilies, such 
as Nymphaea tetragona or slender water 
irises (Iris laevigata) are good choices for 
water aquatics on bricks and lower them to their ﬁnal depth as they grow. 
Fill the pool a few days before planting to allow the water to reach the air 
temperature and become populated with beneﬁcial microorganisms.PLANTING DEPTHS
A pond with a range of planting depths allows you to grow a wide range  
of plants. Place plants at their appropriate depths, measured from the  
top of the soil in their containers to the water surface. Support young deep

The curving edges of an informal pool offer ideal 
conditions for marginals such as Pontederia cordata 
and Sagittaria latifolia. Marginals disguise plastic 
liners and provide shelter for wildlife.a small pond or water feature. Marginal 
plants thrive in shallow water. Many are 
planted just below the surface, while water 
irises prefer a depth of about 6in (15cm) 
and pickerel weeds (Pontederia) like their 
roots submerged to a depth of 12in (30cm).
Marginals help to disguise liners at the 
edges of ponds, create reflections, and 
provide wildlife cover. They have a range  
of habits, from the bog bean (Menyanthes 
trifoliata) with its clusters of white flowers 
in spring, to the flowering rush (Butomus 
umbellatus) with its umbels of small pink 
flowers, and the large, calla-like blooms 
of skunk cabbages (Lysichiton). Larger 
areas can be enhanced by bold clumps  
of cattails (Typha latifolia), while 
architectural plants such as Pontederia 
cordata provide focal points with their 
leaves and flower spikes. 
The damp areas around the edges of  
a pond provide ideal conditions for bog 
natives and moisture-lovers. In very wet 
bogs, marginals will survive, but in drier 
conditions, opt for moisture-lovers. Bog 
gardens must have either drainage or water 
flowing through them to provide oxygen 
for the plant roots. 
Designing with  
water plants
Every garden has space for a water feature 
and its associated plants, but match your 
plants to the size and design of your pond. 
Informal pools have sloping sides and 
boggy banks to attract birds, amphibians, 
and small mammals that prey on garden 
pests. In winter, water that is more than  
24in (60cm) deep will help creatures 
survive freezing temperatures. The great 
specimens that are free of algae and pond weeds. All submerged plants, 
such as water lilies and oxygenators, can be planted in the same way. Lift 
them from the pond for dividing and repotting every two or three years.
1Use a pond basket
Choose a pond basket with small 
holes to prevent soil from leaking out 
into the water. Place a layer of aquatic 
potting mix in the bottom. 2Position the plant
Remove the plant from its pot and  
put it in the center of the basket at the 
same level. Fill around the plant with 
more potting mix, ﬁrming as you go.3Mulch with gravel
Clean any algae or duckweed 
from the plant’s leaves and stems. 
Wash some pea gravel and apply a 
thin layer to stabilize the soil surface.
Established water lily pondPLANTING A POND
Submerged plants are planted in baskets rather than pots, using aquatic 
potting mix. Garden soil is unsuitable because it often contains nutrients 
that encourage the growth of algae. When choosing plants, look for healthy advantage of an informal pool is that it offers 
versatility: its sinuous margins are longer than 
straight-sided ponds of a similar size, and the 
sloping banks provide a range of planting 
depths, increasing your choice of plants.
In small gardens, avoid vigorously 
spreading plants, such as the flag iris 
(Iris pseudacorus) or Glyceria maxima.
For architectural plants for bogs, try 
Filipendula camtschatica and Miscanthus 
sacchariflorus. Astilbes, trollius, primulas, 
and ferns provide color around the edges. 
Seasonal care
In fall, cut away dead foliage, trim over-
sized plants, and remove weeds. It is also  
a good idea to place a net over ponds close 
to deciduous trees, as the fallen leaves can foul the water. Aim to reach a balance, so 
that rotting vegetation releases enough 
nutrition for next year’s growth, but not  
so much as to encourage algae. 
Water plants are best divided and 
repotted in spring as they start into growth. 
Keep planting baskets weeded, removing 
annual weed seedlings as they appear, as 
well as surplus water-plant seedlings. This 
task can be eased by deadheading the  
plants after flowering. Small ponds and 
water features will also need topping off  
in summer, using rainwater if possible.

These beautiful plants are often the focal point in a pond  
or water feature, be it naturalistic or formal. The leaves 
and ﬂowers ﬂoat on the surface, helping to control algae 
and providing cover for ﬁsh and wildlife. There are nearly 
400 species and selections available, with ﬂower colors  
in shades of white, yellow, pink, and red. Blue water lilies  
are not hardy in frost-prone climates. Lilies vary in size, 
and include miniature types that spread up to 24in (60cm) 
in diameter and need a water depth of just 8in (20cm); 
medium lilies, ranging from 3 to 5ft (1–1.5m); and large 
types that extend 5–12ft (1.5–4m) or more—these require  
a water depth of 24in (60cm) or more. All water lilies  
thrive in full sun and must be grown in still water. For 
more details, see the Plant Dictionary.

 TENDER AND 
EXOTIC PLANTS
Tropical and subtropical regions are home to a huge range  
of plants, each thriving in varying growing conditions. If you live 
in these areas, you can grow tender plants outside and create 
dramatic planting schemes with architectural forms and exotic 
flowers. In temperate regions, grow these exotic plants either 
under glass or indoors as houseplants. There is a wealth of form, 
color, and texture available, from plants with handsome foliage  
to those with beautiful blooms, including bougainvilleas and 
peace lilies. Unlike those grown outside, indoor plants are not 
subject to seasonal extremes, and many need relatively little 
attention, apart from watering, fertilizing, and annual repotting.
448Gardeners have long been fascinated by tender and exotic plants that 
bring color and interest from all corners of the world. In warmer regions 
many of these can be grown in the garden, but in cooler areas they’re 
best treated as houseplants, at least for part of the year.TENDER AND EXOTIC PLANTS
What are tender and 
exotic plants?
This group of plants originate from many 
parts of the world, including tropical and 
subtropical areas, where they require 
temperatures no lower than 34–64°F 
(1–18°C), even in winter. Their specific 
cultural demands vary between plants and 
can be complex. In addition to warmth, 
many also require high light levels, long 
growing seasons, and often either very  
arid or humid growing conditions. A small 
few, including cacti and succulents, can 
tolerate frost if kept dry, but most cannot.
  Where the climate allows, tender and 
exotic plants can be grown in the garden; 
where it doesn't, they must be grown 
indoors. The most tender plants require 
permanent protection and are commonly 
grown as houseplants, including flamingoflower, Anthurium andraeanum, peace lily, 
Spathiphyllum wallisii, and Madagascar 
jasmine, Stephanotis floribunda. Other 
plants are more robust and can spend  
the summer in sheltered positions in the 
garden, being brought back in before the 
first frost. These include Banksia coccinea, 
the Australian heath, Epracris impressa, 
and king protea, Protea cynaroides.
Designing with  
tender plants
The range of tender and exotic plants is  
vast, and includes many with bold flowers, 
attractive foliage, or an architectural habit. 
With such a diverse variety to grow, they 
are ideal for many different situations and 
planting styles. In areas where they can be 
grown outdoors all year, they can form the mainstay of beds and borders, even entire 
gardens, from jungle schemes to desert-
style borders. In cooler areas, where they 
can only spend the warm summer months 
outside, they can still play a prominent role. 
Pot-grown plants like Agave americana, 
Ensete ventricosum, and even the bird of 
paradise, Strelitzia reginae, for example, will 
all give a dramatic but temporary display in 
the garden, or on a deck or roof terrace.
Indoors, tender and exotic plants can be 
put to many uses, from statement plants  
in grand reception rooms, and year-round 
greenery in conservatory planters, to lone 
windowsill potted plants for seasonal color. 
ABOVE Exotic flowers for indoors
Frangipani (Plumeria rubra) is famed for its rich scent 
and must be grown permanently in a large heated 
conservatory, where it can become very large. It needs 
a minimum winter temperature of 50°F (10°C).BELOW Dramatic foliage
The Japanese sago palm (Cycas revoluta) is one of 
many tender shrubs that can be enjoyed indoors  
during winter, but can be put outside for summer.  
It is grown for its sculptural foliage and habit. /tsmall/esmall/nsmall/dsmall/esmall/rsmall /asmall/nsmall/dsmall  /esmall/xsmall/osmall/tsmall/ismall/csmall /psmall/lsmall/asmall/nsmall/tsmall/ssmall
ABOVE Conservatory climber
Bougainvillea is a vigorous shrubby climber in warmer 
climates. It needs a minimum temperature of 45°F 
(7°C), and must be treated as a large conservatory 
plant in cooler areas. 
 449LEFT In a natural setting
In their native hot, dry climates, cacti and other 
succulents can achieve spectacular dimensions. Even  
in cooler temperate gardens they can still make a bold 
impression, but they must be brought in for the winter 
and repositioned outside again each summer. 
1Make a base
Fill the base of a large, plastic-
lined container with clay pebbles  
to hold the orchids in place, and to 
provide drainage and humidity. In a 
permanent community planter, you 
should use a suitable planting mix. 2Position the plants
Place the orchids into the container, 
making sure the top of their pots sit just 
below the rim. Make sure the plants are 
upright and facing the right direction, 
before adding more pebbles to hold  
the plants in place.3Dress the top
Add a layer of moss or decorative 
material around the orchids to disguise 
the pots underneath. This will also 
help maintain humidity, although if 
you use natural moss, it will need to 
be sprayed regularly to keep it healthy.
The completed planterMAKING AN ORCHID PLANTER
Orchids, such as Colmanara Masai gx ‘Red’, all require particular conditions 
to perform at their best. Where you have a suitable spot indoors, take full 
advantage of it and position two or more plants in the same container, at least while they‘re in ﬂower. This will serve as a temporary community-
planter, which will beneﬁt the plants, and also create a more attractive 
display than growing them as individual specimens. /tsmall/esmall/nsmall/dsmall/esmall/rsmall /asmall/nsmall/dsmall  /esmall/xsmall/osmall/tsmall/ismall/csmall /psmall/lsmall/asmall/nsmall/tsmall/ssmallWhen choosing and positioning tender 
plants indoors, consider the conditions they 
require. Light levels may be poor, even near 
windows, and air-conditioning and central 
heating can create a dry atmosphere, which 
many plants dislike. Another consideration 
is how large the plants will become;  
many exotic plants commonly grown as 
houseplants, such as Swiss-cheese plant, 
Monstera deliciosa, and Bougainvillea, 
occupy considerable space over time, 
although they can be pruned and trained.Caring for tender plants
Tender and exotic plants, like any other 
garden plant, all have their preferred 
growing conditions, so consider your site, 
soil, and exposure carefully when planting 
outdoors. This is even more important 
when growing them indoors as the plants 
are reliant on you for their care. The best 
approach is to try to mirror their natural 
conditions as closely as possible, providing 
the same degree of heat, light, shade, 
humidity, and ventilation. It is also very important to observe their natural growing 
seasons by fertilizing and watering them 
more frequently when they're in growth, 
less so, if at all, when they are dormant.
Heated conservatories and greenhouses 
provide the best indoor habitat for most 
tender plants, although many also thrive in 
houses. The care they require depends on 
the plant, but as a guide, position sun-loving 
plants near the windows, shade-lovers 
farther away, and maintain high humidity 
levels by standing your plants on trays of 
moist gravel and misting them regularly. 
Some plants, such as moth orchids, 
Phalaenopsis, require good light but not 
direct sunlight. This can be achieved by 
positioning them by a north-facing window, 
or on a shelf close to a bright window. Also 
watch out for pests, which can flourish in 
the favorable conditions you provide. 
Finding areas that provide optimal 
growing conditions for houseplants 
indoors can be difficult, so it is worth 
making best use of them where they occur. 
A good approach is to plant “community 
planters” and grow plants that enjoy 
similar conditions together in a single 
container. This is ideal for sun-loving cacti, 
as well as epiphytic orchids and bromeliads 
that need high humidity, and insectivorous 
plants that prefer very moist soil.

Elegant and exotic, orchids are prized for their unusual 
ﬂowers. There are two main groups. Terrestrials [t] grow 
in a wide range of habitats in the wild; many are at least 
frost hardy. Epiphytes [e], the more showy of the two  
and mostly native to the tropics, cling to tree branches  
or rocks, obtaining nourishment through their leaves and 
aerial roots. An aura of mystique surrounds these plants, 
but their cultivation is not always difﬁcult and some  
thrive indoors as houseplants. They need special growing 
medium and in cool climates must be grown under glass.
An orchid hybrid is called a grex [gx], from the Latin for a 
ﬂock. A grex name applies to all the individual seedlings 
from any given cross, the individual plants of which may also 
be given cultivar names. Several cultivars may also be given 
a Group name within a grex. See also the Plant Dictionary.

Bromeliads, or plants that belong to the family Bromeliaceae, 
are distinguished by their bold, usually rosetted foliage  
and showy ﬂowers in shades of white, red, or purple, borne 
in dense, cylindrical or conical inﬂorescences in summer.  
The ﬂowers are followed by ovoid yellow fruits containing 
large brown seeds. Many bromeliads are epiphytes, or  
air plants (absorbing their food through moisture in the 
atmosphere), and will grow outdoors only in tropical 
regions. In cooler climates, bromeliads make attractive  
houseplants or will thrive in a warm greenhouse. Follow 
watering instructions with care.

African violet is the common name for the genus  
Saintpaulia, although it is often applied to the numerous 
cultivars derived from S. ionantha. These low-growing, 
rosetted, evergreen perennials have a wide range of 
attractive ﬂower colors, varying from white, pink, blue, 
and violet, to bi- or multicolored. Their petal edges can 
berufﬂed, rounded, frilled, or fringed, and leaves are 
somewhat succulent, usually hairy, and, in some cases, 
variegated. They may be grown as summer bedding 
inwarm, humid climates but also make attractive 
houseplants, ﬂowering freely throughout the year if  
kept in a suitable draft-free, light, humid location.

Gingers have been cultivated in Europe for over 100 years  
and bring colorful, intricate ﬂowers, tropical foliage, and, 
quite literally, spice to the garden. Evergreen types need 
tobe overwintered under glass or gradually dried off in  
fall to induce artiﬁcial dormancy, whereas many deciduous 
types such as Roscoea and Cautleya will die off naturally 
and, being frost-hardy, can remain in the ground with  
a protective mulch. Most gingers do not tolerate wet  
winter conditions and beneﬁt from some shade. A brighter 
location encourages ﬂowering, whereas shade encourages 
better foliage, so site accordingly. They should not be 
allowed to dry out while in growth, and are heavy feeders, 
so give them frequent applications of liquid fertilizer.

Tough plants originating from the Americas, agaves  
are able to withstand drought, heat, and full sun. Some 
species are frost-hardy too. Agaves arrest attention  
with bold rosettes of thick sculptured leaves, often of 
great architectural value. The rosette slowly increases in 
size over several years before producing a ﬂower spike, 
sometimes of treelike proportions, so site carefully. Some 
species die after ﬂowering, but may produce seed, bulbils 
among the ﬂowers, and offsets around the base of the old 
rosette. Care should be taken when planting due to sharp 
thorns at the end of the leaves.

Aloes are abundant in Mediterranean and African 
gardens. There is a huge range of species and hybrids 
providing a kaleidoscope of growth forms, ﬂowers,  
and leaf variegation. Unlike agaves, aloes do not die  
after ﬂowering, but gradually produce a trunk, becoming 
shrubs or small trees. Aloes typically produce their  
leaves singly, and the center of the rosette is usually 
hollow, reminiscent of a bromeliad. A few species, such 
as A. aristata, are frost-hardy, and can be grown in rock 
gardens or at the base of a south-facing wall in mild areas.
