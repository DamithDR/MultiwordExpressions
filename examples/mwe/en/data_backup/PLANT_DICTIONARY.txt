free-draining, soil-based potting mix. Stake
tall plants. Propagate in spring by seed or
tip cuttings.
Rex-cultorum begonias
Mostly evergreen, rhizomatous perennials
of variable habit derived from crosses of
B. rex and related species. They are grown
for their brilliantly colored, oval to lanceshaped
leaves, 3–12in (8–30cm) long, that
are sometimes spirally twisted. Prefer
40–75% relative humidity. Grow under
glass in cool climates, in partial shade
and well-drained soil; water only sparingly.
Do not allow water to remain on the leaves,
otherwise they become susceptible to
botrytis. Propagate in spring by seed,
leaf cuttings or division of rhizomes.
Rhizomatous begonias
Variable, mostly evergreen, rhizomatous
perennials, grown for their foliage and
small, single flowers. Smooth, crested or
puckered, green or brown leaves, 3–12in
(8–30cm) long, often marked silver, are
sometimes spirally twisted. Creeping
cultivars are more freely branched than
erect ones and are useful for hanging
baskets. Prefer 40–75% relative humidity.
Grow under glass in cool climates, in
partial shade and well-drained soil; water
only sparingly. Do not allow water to
remain on the leaves, otherwise they
become susceptible to botrytis. Propagate
in spring by seed, leaf cuttings or division
of rhizomes.
Semperflorens begonias
Evergreen, bushy perennials, derived from
B. cucullata var. hookeri, B. schmidtiana and
other species, often grown as half-hardy
bedding annuals. Stems are soft, succulent
and branch freely, bearing generally
rounded, green, bronze or variegated
leaves, 2in (5cm) long. Flowers are single
or double. Pinch out growing tips to
produce bushy plants. Needs sun or partial
shade and well-drained soil. Propagate in
spring by seed or stem cuttings.
Shrublike begonias
Evergreen, multistemmed, bushy
perennials, usually freely branched with
flexible, erect or pendent stems, often hairy.
Leaves may be hairy or glabrous and up to
6in (15cm) across, 4–12in (10–30cm) long.
Single flowers are pink, cream or white.
Prefer 55% relative humidity. Grow under

BEGONIA
glass in good light and moist but welldrained
soil. Propagate in spring by seed
or stem cuttings.
Tuberous begonias (including the
Tuberhybrida, Multiflora and Pendula
begonias)
Mostly upright, bushy, tuberous, winterdormant
perennials grown for their foliage
and flowers. Tuberhybrida begonias, H and
S 30in (75cm), vary from pendent to erect,
with sparsely branched, succulent stems
and oval, pointed, glossy, bright to dark
green leaves, 8in (20cm) long. Most are
summer flowering and mainly doubleflowered.
Multiflora cultivars, H and S 12in
(30cm), are more bushy and have 3in (8cm)
long leaves and single, semidouble or
double flowers, each 11/2–2in (4–5cm)
across, in summer; tolerates full sun.
Pendula cultivars, H to 3ft (1m), have long,
thin, trailing stems; leaves are 21/2–3in
(6–8cm) long. Masses of single or double
flowers are borne in summer. Outdoors,
grow in dappled shade and moist
conditions; under glass, plant in cool shade
with 65–70% relative humidity. Tubers are
dormant in winter. Start into growth in
spring for mid-summer to early fall
flowering. Remove all flower buds until
stems show at least 3 pairs of leaves; with
large-flowered types allow only central
male bud to flower, so remove flanking
buds. Plants may require staking.
Propagate in spring by seed, stem or
basal cuttings or division of tubers.
Winter-flowering begonias
Evergreen, low-growing, very compact
perennials, with succulent, thin stems,
that are often included in the tuberous
group. Two main groups are recognized:
the single-flowered, usually pink or white,
Lorraine, Cheimantha or Christmas
begonias; and the single, semidouble
or double, Elatior and Rieger begonias,
which occur in a wide range of colors.
Leaves are green or bronze, 2in (5cm) long.
Flowers are borne mainly from late fall to
mid-spring. Prefer 40% relative humidity.
Prefers indirect sun and moist soil.
Cut back old stems to 4in (10cm) after
flowering. Propagate in spring by seed
or stem cuttings.

CHRYSANTHEMUM
COMPOSITAE/ASTERACEAE
Genus of annuals, perennials, some of
which are evergreen, and evergreen
subshrubs, grown for their flowers. Each
flower head is referred to horticulturally as
a flower, even though it does in fact
comprise a large number of individual
flowers or florets; this horticultural usage
has been followed in the descriptions
below. Leaves are usually deeply lobed or
cut, often feathery, oval to lance-shaped.
Florists’ chrysanthemums (nowadays
considered to belong to the genus
Dendranthema) comprise the vast majority
of chrysanthemums now cultivated and are
perennials grown for garden decoration,
cutting and exhibition. Florists’
chrysanthemums (and the other
chrysanthemums treated here) generally
perform well in Z5–9 H9–5; for extra
protection, crowns should be lifted and
stored in a frost-free place over winter.
Needs a sunny site and reasonably fertile,
well-drained soil. If grown for exhibition,
requires regular feeding. Pinch out
growing tips to encourage lateral growths

CHRYSANTHEMUM
on which flowers will be borne, and stake
tall plants with canes. Propagate annuals
by seed sown in position in spring; thin
out, but do not transplant. Propagate hardy
perennials by division in fall, after
flowering, or in early spring. Florists’
chrysanthemums should be propagated
from basal softwood cuttings in spring.
Spray regularly to control aphids, capsids,
froghoppers, earwigs, mildew and white
rust.
Florists’ chrysanthemums
Florists’ chrysanthemums are grouped
according to their widely varying flower
forms, approximate flowering season
(early, mid- or late fall) and habit. They are
divided into disbudded and non-disbudded
types. For descriptions and illustrations of
flower forms, see feature panel pp.252–3.
Disbudded types—single, anemonecentered,
incurved, intermediate and
reflexed—are so called because all buds,
except the one that is to flower, are
removed from each stem. To produce
exhibition flowers, incurved, intermediate
and reflexed chrysanthemums may be
restricted to only 2 blooms per plant by
removing all except the 2 most vigorous
lateral growths. In gardens, allow 4 or 5
blooms per plant to develop. Single and
anemone-centered flowers should be
reduced to 4–8 blooms per plant for
exhibition, according to their vigor, and 10
or more for garden decoration or cutting.
Non-disbudded types—charm, pompom
and spray chrysanthemums—have several
flowers per stem.
Charm chrysanthemums are dwarf plants
that produce hundreds of star-shaped,
single flowers, 1in (2.5cm) across, densely
covering each plant to form a
hemispherical to almost spherical head.
For exhibition, finish growing in at least
12in (30cm) pots. Plants for indoor
decoration are grown in smaller pots and
have correspondingly smaller, though
equally dense, heads of blooms.
Pompom chrysanthemums are also dwarf.
Each plant has 50 or more dense, spherical
or occasionally hemispherical, fully double
flowers that have tubular petals (for
illustrations see p.252). They are excellent
for growing in borders.
Semi-pompom chrysanthemums,
sometimes called Japanese pompom, have
similar flowers to those of the pompom but
as they mature the yellow centers are
revealed.
Spray chrysanthemums have a variety of
flower forms: single, anemone-centered,
intermediate, reflexed, pompom, spoonshaped
(in which each straight, tubular
floret opens out like a spoon at its tip),
quill-shaped and spider-form. Each plant
should be allowed to develop 4 or 5 stems
with at least 5 flowers per stem. Grow l
ate-flowering sprays on up to 3 stems
per plant. With controlled day length, to
regulate flowering dates for exhibition
purposes, late sprays should be allowed
to develop at least 12 flowers per stem;
without day length control, 6 or 7 flowers
per stem.
Korean Group chrysanthemums
Korean Group chrysanthemums have a
variety of flower forms: anemone-centered,
pompom, reflexed, single, intermediate,
spider, quill and spoon. All are derived
from plants originally developed in
Connecticut in the 1930s and the prime
quality, which they all have in common, is
their dependable hardiness: they can be left
in the ground all winter without protection.
They are ideal for general garden use, in
fact they require little special treatment
other than good winter drainage; their
hardiness can be compromised if grown in
poorly drained soil. Some are usefully late
in coming into flower; some need support
while others are short and bushy. The taller
types make good cut flowers.
Those most suitable for garden decoration
are sprays, pompoms and early reflexed
chrysanthemums. All are suitable for
cutting, except for charms. Late-flowering
chrysanthemums are suitable for growing
only under glass as flowers need protection
from poor weather; they should be grown
in pots and placed in a greenhouse in early
fall, when the flower buds have developed.
Intermediate cultivars are also less suitable
for garden decoration as florets may collect
and retain rain and thus become damaged.
Those cultivars suitable for exhibition are
noted below. Measurements of flowers
given are the greatest normally achieved
and may vary considerably depending on

CLEMATIS
RANUNCULACEAE
Genus of evergreen or deciduous, mainly
twining climbers and herbaceous
perennials, cultivated for their mass of
flowers, often followed by decorative seed
heads, and grown on walls and trellises
and together with trees, shrubs and other
host plants. Only early-flowering species
are evergreen, although some laterflowering
species are semievergreen. Most
species have nodding, bell-shaped flowers,
with 4 petals (botanically known as
perianth segments), or flattish flowers,
each usually with 4–6 generally pointed
petals. Large-flowered cultivars also bear
flattish flowers, but with 4–10 petals.
Flower color may vary according to
climatic conditions: in general, the warmer
the climate, the darker the flower color.
May be grown in partial shade or full sun,
but prefers rich, well-drained soil with
roots shaded. Propagate cultivars in early
summer by softwood or semiripe cuttings
or layering, species from seed in fall.
Aphids, mildew and clematis wilt may
cause problems.
Clematis may be divided into groups
according to their flowering seasons, habit
and pruning needs. See also feature panel
pp.198–200.
Group 1
Early-flowering species prefers a
sheltered, sunny site with well-drained
soil. Small, single flowers, either bellshaped
or open-bell-shaped, 1/2–2in
(2–5cm) long, or saucer-shaped, 11/4–2in
(4–5cm) across, are borne on the previous
season’s ripened shoots in spring or,
occasionally, in late winter. Leaves are
evergreen and glossy, or deciduous, and
usually divided into 3 lance-shaped,
5in (12cm) long leaflets or into 3 fernlike,
2in (5cm) long leaflets.
C. alpina, C. macropetala and their
cultivars tolerate cold, exposed positions.
Small, bell-shaped to open bell-shaped,
single, semidouble or double flowers,
2in (5cm) across, are borne on the previous
season’s ripened shoots in spring,
occasionally also on the current season’s
shoots in summer. Deciduous, pale to
mid-green leaves are divided into 3–5
lance-shaped to broadly oblong, toothed
leaflets, 11/4in (3cm) long.
C. montana and its cultivars are
vigorous, deciduous climbers, suitable for
growing over large buildings and trees.
Small, flat to saucer-shaped, usually single
flowers, 2–3in (5–7cm) across, are borne on
the previous season’s ripened shoots in late
spring. Leaves are mid- to purplish-green
and divided into 3 lance-shaped to broadly
oval, serrated leaflets, 3in (8cm) long with
pointed tips.
Prune all group 1 clematis after flowering
to allow new growth to be produced and
ripened for the following season. Remove
dead or damaged stems and cut back other
shoots that have outgrown their allotted
space. This will encourage new growth to
bear flowers in the following season.
Group 2
Early- to mid-season, large-flowered
cultivars bearing mostly saucer-shaped,
single, semidouble or fully double flowers,
4–8in (10–20cm) across, that are borne on
the previous season’s ripened shoots, in
late spring and early summer, and on new
shoots in mid- and late summer. Generally
the second flush of flowers on semidouble
and double forms produces single flowers.
Deciduous, pale to mid-green leaves are
usually 4–6in (10–15cm) long and divided
into 3 ovate or lance-shaped leaflets, or are
simple and ovate, and to 4in (10cm) long.
Prune before new growth starts, in early
spring. Remove any dead or damaged
stems and cut back all remaining shoots
to where strong buds are visible. These
buds provide a framework of second-year
shoots which, in turn, produce sideshoots
that flower in late spring and early summer.
The flowers may then be removed. Young
shoots bear more flowers later in the
summer.
Group 3
Late, large-flowered cultivars
producing outward-facing, usually saucershaped,
single flowers, 3–6in (7–15cm)
across, borne on new shoots in summer or
early fall. Leaves are deciduous and similar
to those of early cultivars (group 2),
described above.
Late-flowering species and smallflowered
cultivars that bear small, single
or double flowers on the current season’s
shoots in summer–fall. Flowers vary in
shape and may be star-shaped, tubular,
bell-shaped, flattish or resembling nodding
lanterns; they vary in size from 1/2in (1cm)
to 4in (10cm) across. Have generally
deciduous, pale to dark green or graygreen
leaves divided into 3 lance-shaped to
broadly oval leaflets, each 1/2in (1cm) long,
or hairy and/or toothed leaves divided into
5 or more lance-shaped to broadly oval
leaflets, each 1/2–4in (1–10cm) long.
Herbaceous species and cultivars
producing single flowers that are either
saucer-shaped, 1/2–3/4in (1–2cm) wide, or
bell-shaped or tubular, 1/2–11/2in (1–4cm)
long, and are produced on the current
season’s shoots in summer. Mid- to dark
green or gray-green leaves are simple and
lance-shaped to elliptic, 1–6in (2.5–15cm)
long, or are divided into 3–5 lance-shaped
to ovate, serrated leaflets, each 4–6in
(10–15cm) long with a pointed tip. Prune
all group 3 clematis before new growth
begins, in early spring. Cut back all the
previous season’s stems to a pair of strong
buds, 6–8in (15–20cm) above soil level.

CONIFERS
Group of trees and shrubs, distinguished
botanically from others by producing seeds
exposed or uncovered on the scales of
fruits. Most conifers are evergreen, have
needlelike leaves and bear woody fruits
(cones). All genera in the Cupressaceae
family, however, have needlelike juvenile
leaves and, excepting many junipers and
some other selected forms, scalelike adult
leaves. Conifers described in this book are
evergreen unless otherwise stated.
Conifers are excellent garden plants.
Most provide year-round foliage, which
may be green, blue, gray, bronze, gold or
silver. They range in height from trees 130ft
(40m) or more tall to dwarf shrubs that
grow less than 2in (5cm) every 10 years.
Tall conifers may be planted as specimen
trees or to provide shelter, screening or
hedging. Dwarf conifers make good
features in their own right as well as in
groups; they also associate well with
heathers, add variety to rock gardens and
provide excellent groundcover. They may
also be grown in containers.
Position and soil
Cupressus, x Cuprocyparis, Larix and
Pinus need full sun. Cedrus, Juniperus
and Pseudolarix do not tolerate shade. All
other conifers will thrive in sun or shade,
and most Abies and all Cephalotaxus,
Podocarpus, Taxus, Thuja, Torreya and
Tsuga will grow in deep shade once
established. Wollemia prefers a sheltered
location out of full sun.
Conifers grow well on most soils, but
certain genera and species will not do well
on soils over chalk or limestone. In this
book, such conifers are: Abies, Pseudolarix,
Pseudotsuga and Tsuga; also Picea, except
P. likiangensis, P. omorika and P. pungens;
and Pinus, except P. aristata, P. armandii,
P. cembroides, P. halepensis, P. heldreichii,
P. nigra, P. peuce and P. wallichiana.
Certain conifers tolerate extreme
conditions. Abies alba, A. homolepis,
A. nordmanniana, Cryptomeria,
Cunninghamia, Metasequoia, Pinus coulteri,
P. peuce, P. ponderosa, Sciadopitys,
Sequoia, Sequoiadendron and Taxodium
will grow on heavy clay soils. Picea
omorika, P. sitchensis, Pinus contorta,
Sciadopitys verticillata and Thuja plicata are
all happy on wet soil, and Metasequoia and
Taxodium thrive in waterlogged conditions.
Cupressus, Juniperus and Pinus grow well
on dry, sandy soil.
Pruning
If a conifer produces more than one leader,
remove all but one. Bear in mind when
trimming hedges that most conifers will not
make new growth when cut back into old
wood or from branches that have turned
brown. This does not, however, apply to
Cephalotaxus, Cryptomeria, Cunninghamia,
Sequoia, Taxus, Torreya and Wollemia, and
these conifers may be kept to a reasonable
size in the garden by cutting back the main
stem, which will later coppice (make new
growth). Young specimens of Araucaria,
Ginkgo, Metasequoia and Taxodium will
sometimes do the same.

COREOPSIS
Propagation
Seed is the easiest method of
propagation, but forms selected for leaf
color (other than blue in some species)
do not come true. Sow in fall or spring.
All genera apart from Abies, Cedrus,
Picea (except young plants or dwarf
forms), Pinus, Pseudolarix, Pseudotsuga
and Tsuga (except young plants or dwarf
forms) may be raised fairly easily from
cuttings: current growth from fall to
spring for evergreens, softwood cuttings
in summer for deciduous conifers. Tallgrowing
forms of Pinaceae (Abies,
Cedrus, Picea, Pinus, Pseudolarix,
Pseudotsuga and Tsuga) are usually
propagated by grafting in late summer,
winter or early spring. Layering may be
possible for some dwarf conifers. It is
illegal to propagate Wollemia nobilis.
Pests and diseases
Honey fungus attacks many conifers,
especially young plants. Most resistant to
the disease are Abies, Calocedrus, Larix,
Pseudotsuga and Taxus. Green spruce
aphid may be a problem on Picea, and
conifer spinning mite may defoliate Abies,
Picea and some Pinus.
Conifers are illustrated on pp.95–105,
dwarf forms on pp.105. See also Abies,

DAHLIA
DAHLIA
COMPOSITAE/ASTERACEAE
Genus of bushy, summer- and fall-flowering,
tuberous perennials, grown as bedding
plants or for their flower heads, which are
good for cutting or exhibition. Dwarf forms
are used for mass-planting and are also
suitable for containers. Needs a sunny
position and well-drained soil. All apart
from dwarf forms require staking. After
flowering, lift tubers and store in a frost-free
place; replant once all frost danger has
passed. In frost-free areas, plants may be left
in ground as normal herbaceous perennials,
but they benefit from regular propagation to
maintain vigor. Propagate dwarf forms
by seed sown under glass in late winter,
others in spring by seed, basal shoot
cuttings or division of tubers. Dahlias may
be subject to attack by aphids, red spider
mite and thrips. In recent years, powdery
mildew has become a problem in certain
areas, and spraying is essential. Dahlias also
succumb quickly to virus infection. See also
feature panel pp.396–98.
Border dahlias
Prolific and long-flowering, various species
of Dahlia have been hybridized and, with
constant breeding and selection, have
developed into many forms and have a
wide color range (although there is no
blue). Shoots may be stopped, or pinched
out, to promote vigorous growth and
a bushy shape. Spread measurements
depend on the amount of stopping carried
out and the time at which it is done: early
stopping encourages a broader shape,
stopping later in the growing season
results in a taller plant with much less
spread, even in the same cultivar. Leaves
are generally mid-green and divided into
oval leaflets, some with rounded tips and
some with toothed margins. Each flower
head is referred to horticulturally as a
flower, even though it does in fact comprise
a large number of individual flowers. This
horticultural usage has been followed in
the descriptions below. All forms with
flower heads to 6in (15cm) across are
suitable for cutting; those suitable for
exhibition are so noted.
Groups and flower sizes
Dahlias are divided into groups, according
to the size and type of their flower heads,
although the latter may vary in color
and shape depending on soil and weather
conditions. The groups are: (1) single;
(2) anemone; (3) collerette; (4) water-lily;
(5) decorative; (6) ball; (7) pompon; (8) cactus;
(9) semi-cactus; (10) miscellaneous;
(11) fimbriated; (12) single orchid; (13) double
orchid. For illustrations and descriptions
see p.396. Certain groups have been
subdivided; flower sizes are as follows:
Groups 4, 5, 8 and 9
A—giant-flowered; usually over 10in
(25cm) in diameter. B—large-flowered;
usually 8–10in (20–25cm) in diameter.
C—medium-flowered; usually 6–8in
(15–20cm) in diameter. D—small-flowered;
usually 4–6in (10–15cm) in diameter.
E—miniature-flowered; usually not
exceeding 4in (10cm) in diameter.
Group 6

DIANTHUS
Carnation, Pink
CARYOPHYLLACEAE
Genus of evergreen or semievergreen,
mainly summer-flowering perennials,
annuals and biennials, grown for their
mass of flowers, often scented, some of
which are excellent for cutting. Carnations
and pinks (see below) are excellent for cut
flowers and border decoration, the biennial
D. barbatus is suitable for bedding and
smaller, tuft-forming species and cultivars
are good for rock gardens. Needs an open,
sunny position and well-drained, slightly
alkaline soil, except for D. pavonius, which
prefers acid soil. Dead-heading of repeatflowering
types is beneficial. Tall forms of
carnations and pinks have a loose habit
and need staking. Propagate border
carnations by layering in late summer,
other named forms by softwood cuttings in
early to mid-summer and species by seed
at any time. Is susceptible to rust, red
spider mite and virus infection through
aphids, but many cultivars are available
from virus-free stock.
Carnations and pinks have narrowly
lance-shaped, silvery- or gray-green leaves,
scattered up flower stems, which may coil
outwards on carnations. They are divided
into the following groups, all with
self-colored and bicolored cultivars.
See also feature panel pp.266–67.
Carnations
Border carnations are annuals or
evergreen perennials that flower prolifically
once in mid-summer and are good for
border decoration and cutting. Each stem
bears 5 or more often scented, semidouble
or double flowers, to 3in (8cm) across;
picotee forms (with petals outlined in a
darker color) are available. H 21⁄2–31⁄2ft
(75cm–1.1m), S to 1ft (30cm).
Perpetual-flowering carnations are
evergreen perennials that flower yearround
if grown in a greenhouse, but more
prolifically in summer. They are normally
grown for cut flowers: flower stems should
be disbudded, leaving one terminal bud
per stem. Fully double flowers, to 4in
(10cm) across, are usually unscented and
are often flecked or streaked. H 3–5ft
(1–1.5m), S 1ft (30cm) or more.
Spray forms are not disbudded so have
5 or more flowers per stem, each 2–21⁄2in
(5–6cm) across. H 2–3ft (60cm–1m), S to 1ft
(30cm).
Malmaison carnations are evergreen
perennials, derived from D. ‘Souvenir de la
Malmaison’. Grown under glass, they bear
large, double, scented flowers sporadically
during the year. The flowers can reach up
to 5in (13cm) across. They are mostly selfcolored,
and tend to split their calyces.
H 20–28in (50–70cm), S 16in (40cm).
Pinks
Evergreen, clump-forming perennials,
grown for border decoration and cutting,
that in summer produce a succession of
basal shoots, each bearing 4–6 fragrant,
single to fully double flowers, 11⁄2–21⁄2in
(3.5–6cm) across. H 12–18in (30–45cm),
S 9–12in (23–30cm) or more.
Old-fashioned pinks have a low,
spreading habit and produce masses of
flowers in one flowering period in midsummer.
Mule types (a border carnation
crossed with a Sweet William) and laced
types (in which the central color extends as
a loop around each petal) are available.
Modern pinks, obtained by crossing an
old-fashioned pink with a perpetualflowering
carnation, are more vigorous
than old-fashioned pinks, and are repeatflowering
with 2 or 3 main flushes of
flowers in summer.
Alpine pinks are evergreen species and
cultivars forming neat mat or cushion
plants. They will grow at the edge of
borders or in rock gardens, troughs or

FUCHSIA
ONAGRACEAE
Genus of deciduous or evergreen shrubs
and trees, grown for their flowers, usually
borne from early summer to early fall. If
temperature remains above 39°F (4°C),
deciduous plants are evergreen, but
temperatures above 90°F (32°C) should
be avoided. Prolonged low temperatures
cause loss of top growth. If top growth
dies in winter, cut back to ground level
in spring. Needs a sheltered, partially
shaded position, except where stated
otherwise, and fertile, moist but welldrained
soil. When grown as container
plants in a greenhouse, fuchsias also need
high-nitrogen feeds and, when flowering,
plenty of potash. Propagate by softwood
cuttings in any season.
Tubular flowers are almost always
pendulous and often bicolored, with petals
of one hue, and a tube and 4 sepals of
another. Leaves are oval and mid-green
unless otherwise stated. Spherical to
cylindrical, usually blackish-purple fruits
are edible, but mostly poor-flavored.
Upright types may be trained as compact
bushes or standards or, with more
difficulty, as pyramids. Lax or trailing
plants are good for hanging baskets, but
may be trained on trellises; if they are used
for summer bedding, they require staking.
Heights given in descriptions below are of
plants grown in frost-free conditions. See

succulents, grown for their pairs of small,
swollen leaves, often of unequal size.
Needs full sun and very well-drained
soil. Water very lightly in early winter.
Propagate by seed or stem cuttings in
spring or summer.

G. velutinum, illus. p.481.
GILIA
POLEMONIACEAE
Genus of summer- and fall-flowering
annuals. Prefers sun and fertile, very
well-drained soil. Stems may need
support, especially on windy sites.
Propagate by seed sown outdoors in
spring, or in early fall for early flowering
the following year.

GLADIOLUS
IRIDACEAE
Genus of corms, each producing a spike
of funnel-shaped flowers and a fan of
erect, sword-shaped leaves on basal part
of flower stem. Is suitable for cutting or
for planting in mixed borders; most
hybrids are also good for exhibition.
Needs sun and fertile, well-drained soil.
Plant 4–6in (10–15cm) deep and the same
distance apart in spring. Water well in
summer and support tall cultivars with
canes. Lift half-hardy types in fall, cut off
stems and dry corms in a frost-free but
cool place. Pot up spring-flowering
species and cultivars in fall and place in
a cool greenhouse; after flowering, dry
off corms during summer months and
repot in fall.
Propagate by seed or by removal of
young cormlets from parent. Seed sown
in early spring in a cool greenhouse will
take 2–3 years to flower and may not
breed true to type. Cormlets, removed
after lifting, should be stored in frost-free
conditions and then be planted out 2in
(5cm) deep in spring; lift in winter as
for mature corms. They will flower in
1–2 years.
While in storage, corms may be attacked
by various rots. Protect sound, healthy
corms by dusting with a fungicide or
soaking in a fungicide solution before
drying; store in an airy, cool, frost-free
place. Gladiolus scab causes blotches
on leaves; gladiolus yellows shows as

yellowing stripes on leaves, which then
die; in both cases, destroy affected corms.
As a preventative measure, always plant
healthy corms in a new site each year.

GRASSES, BAMBOOS,
RUSHES AND SEDGES
Group of evergreen or herbaceous,
perennial and annual grasses or grasslike
plants belonging to the Gramineae
(including Bambusoideae), Juncaceae
and Cyperaceae families. They are grown
mainly as foliage plants, adding grace
and contrast to borders and rock gardens,
although several grasses have attractive
flower heads in summer that may be dried
for winter decoration. Dead foliage may
be cut back on herbaceous perennials
when dormant. Propagate species by seed
in spring or fall or by division in spring,
selected forms by division only. Pests and
diseases usually give little trouble. Grasses,
bamboos, rushes and sedges are illustrated
on pp.284–49.
Grasses (Gramineae)
Family of evergreen, semievergreen
or herbaceous, sometimes creeping
perennials, annuals and marginal water
plants, usually with rhizomes or stolons,
that form tufts, clumps or carpets. All
have basal leaves and rounded flower
stems that bear alternate, long, narrow
leaves. Flowers are bisexual (males and
females in same spikelet) and are
arranged in panicles, racemes or spikes.
Each flower head comprises spikelets,
with one or more florets, that are covered
with glumes (scales) from which awns
(long, slender bristles) may grow. Unless
otherwise stated, grasses will tolerate
a range of light conditions and flourish
in any well-drained soil. Many genera,
such as Briza, self-seed readily. See

Bamboos (Bambusoideae)
Sub-family of Gramineae, comprising
evergreen, rhizomatous perennials,
sometimes grown as hedging as well as
for ornamentation. Most bamboos differ
from other perennial grasses in that they
have woody stems (culms). These are
hollow (except in Chusquea), mostly
greenish-brown and, due to their silica
content, very strong, with a circumference
of up to 6in (15cm) in some tropical species.
Leaves are lance-shaped with cross veins
that give a tessellated appearance, which
may be obscured in the more tender
species. Flowers are produced at varying
intervals but are not decorative. After
flowering, stems die down but few plants
die completely. Bamboos thrive in a
sheltered, not too dry situation in sun
or shade, unless otherwise stated. See
also Bambusa, Chusquea, Fargesia,
Himalayacalamus, Phyllostachys,
Pleioblastus, Pseudosasa, Sasa,

G
GYNURA
leafless stems or stems bearing long,
narrow, basal leaves that are flat and
hairless except Luzula (woodrushes)
which has flat leaves, edged with
white hairs. Rounded flower heads are
generally unimportant. Most rushes
prefer sun or partial shade and a moist
or wet situation, but Luzula prefers drier
conditions. See also Isolepis, Juncus
and Luzula.
Sedges (Cyperaceae)
Family of evergreen, rhizomatous
perennials that form dense tufts. Stems
are triangular and bear long, narrow
leaves, sometimes reduced to scales.
Spikes or panicles of florets covered with
glumes are produced and contain both
male and female flowers, although some
species of Carex have separate male and
female flower heads on the same stem.
Grow in sun or partial shade. Some
sedges grow naturally in water, but many
may be grown in any well-drained soil.

HEATHERS
ERICACEAE
Heathers (otherwise known as heaths) are
evergreen, woody-stemmed shrubs, grown
for their flowers and foliage, both of which
may provide color in the garden all year
round. There are 3 genera: Calluna,
Daboecia and Erica. Calluna has only one
species, C. vulgaris, but it contains a large
number of cultivars that flower mainly
from mid-summer to late fall. Daboecia
has 2 species, both of which are summerflowering.
The largest genus is Erica, which,
although broadly divided into 2 groups—
winter- and summer-flowering species—has
some species also flowering in spring and
fall. They vary in height from tree heaths,
which may grow to 20ft (6m), to dwarf,
prostrate plants that, if planted apart, soon
spread to form a thick mat of groundcover.
Heathers prefer an open, sunny position
and require rich, well-drained soil. Calluna
and Daboecia dislike limestone and must
be grown in acid soil; some species of Erica
tolerate slightly alkaline soil but all are
better grown in acid soils. Prune lightly
after flowering each year to keep plants
bushy and compact. Propagate species
by seed in spring or by softwood cuttings,
division or layering in summer. Seed cannot
be relied onto come true. All cultivars
should be vegetatively propagated.
Heathers are illustrated on p.166.

HEDERA
Ivy
ARALIACEAE
Genus of evergreen, woody-stemmed,
trailing perennials and self-clinging
climbers with adventitious rootlets, used
for covering walls and fences and as
groundcover. Takes a year or so to become
established, but thereafter growth is rapid.
On the ground and while climbing, mostly
bears roughly triangular, usually lobed
leaves. Given extra height and access to
light, leaves become less lobed and, in fall,
umbels of small, yellowish-green flowers
are produced, followed by globose, black,
occasionally yellow, fruits. Ivies with green
leaves are very shade tolerant and do well
against a north-facing wall. Those with
variegated or yellow leaves prefer more
light, are usually less hardy and may
sustain frost and wind damage in severe
winters. All prefer well-drained, alkaline
soil. Prune in spring to control height and
spread, and to remove any damaged
growth. Propagate in late summer by
softwood cuttings or rooted layers. Red
spider mite may be a problem when plants
are grown against a south-facing wall or
in dry conditions. T All parts of ivy may
cause severe discomfort if ingested; contact
with the sap may aggravate skin allergies
or irritate skin.

AQUIFOLIACEAE
Genus of evergreen or deciduous trees and
shrubs, grown for their foliage and fruits
Mainly spherical berries, ranging in color
from red through yellow to black, are
produced in fall, following insignificant,
usually white, flowers borne in spring.
Almost all plants are unisexual, and to
obtain fruits on a female plant a male also
needs to be grown. All prefer well-drained
soil. Grow in sun or shade, but deciduous
plants and those with variegated foliage do
best in sun or partial shade. Hollies resent
being transplanted, but respond well to
hard pruning which should be done in late
spring. Propagate by seed in spring or by
semiripe cuttings from late summer to
early winter. Holly leaf miners and holly
aphids may cause problems. T Berries
may cause mild stomach upset if ingested.

IRIS
IRIDACEAE
Genus of upright, rhizomatous or bulbous
(occasionally fleshy-rooted) perennials,
some of which are evergreen, grown for
their distinctive and colorful flowers. Each
flower has 3 usually large “falls” (pendent or
semi-pendent petals), which in a number of
species have conspicuous beards or crests;
3 generally smaller “standards” (erect,
horizontal or, occasionally, pendent petals);
and a 3-branched style. In many irises, the
style branches are petal-like. Unless
otherwise stated below, flower stems are
unbranched. Green, then brown seed pods
are ellipsoid to cylindrical and often ribbed.
Irises are suitable for borders, rock gardens,
woodlands, watersides, bog gardens, alpine
houses, cold frames and containers. Some
groups thrive only in the specific growing
conditions mentioned below. Propagate
species by division of rhizomes or offsets
in late summer or by seed in fall, named
cultivars by division only.
Botanically, irises are divided into
a number of sub-genera and sections,
and it is convenient, for horticultural
purposes, to use some of these botanical
names for groups of irises with similar
characteristics and requiring comparable
cultural treatment. T All parts may cause
severe discomfort if ingested; contact
with the sap may irritate skin. See also
feature panel pp.224–25.
Rhizomatous These irises have rhizomes
as rootstocks; leaves are sword-shaped and
usually in a basal fan.
Bearded irises are rhizomatous and have
“beards,” consisting of numerous often
colored hairs, along the center of each
fall. In some irises, the end of the beard
is enlarged into the shape of a horn. The
group covers the vast majority of irises,
including many named cultivars, grown
in gardens; all are derived from I. pallida
and related species. Bearded irises thrive
in full sun in fairly rich, well-drained,
preferably slightly alkaline soil. Some are
very tolerant and will grow and flower
reasonably in partial shade in poorer soil.
For horticultural purposes, various
groupings of hybrid bearded irises are
recognized, based mainly on the height
of the plants in flower. These include
Miniature Dwarf, H to 8in (20cm);
Standard Dwarf, H 8–16in (20–40cm);
Intermediate, H 16–28in (40–70cm);
and Tall, H 28in (70cm) or more (this
last category may be further subdivided).
In general, the shorter the iris, the earlier
the flowering season (from early spring
to early summer). Oncocyclus irises are
rhizomatous, with very large and often
bizarrely colored flowers, one to each
stem, which have bearded falls. They
require full sun, sharply drained but
fairly rich soil and, after flowering, a dry
period of dormancy in summer and early
fall. Difficult to cultivate successfully,
they are best grown in an alpine house
or covered frame in climates subject to
summer rains.
Regelia irises are closely related to
Oncocyclus irises, differing in having
bearded standards as well as falls and
in having 2 flowers to each stem. They
require similar conditions of cultivation,
although a few species, such as I. hoogiana,
have proved easier to grow than
Oncocyclus irises. Hybrids between the
2 groups have been raised and are known
as Regeliocyclus irises.
Beardless irises, also rhizomatous, lack
hairs on the falls; most have very similar
cultural requirements to bearded irises
but some prefer heavier soil. Various
groupings are recognized, of which the
following are the most widely known.
Pacific Coast irises, a group of
Californian species and their hybrids,
prefer acidic to neutral soil and grow well
in sun or partial shade, appreciating some
humus in the soil; they are best grown from
seed as they resent being moved. Spuria
irises (I. spuria and its relatives) grow in
sun or partial shade and well-drained
but moist soil. A number of species and
hybrids prefers moist, waterside
conditions; these include the well-known
Siberian irises (I. sibirica and its relatives)
and the Japanese water irises, such as
I. ensata and I. laevigata, which may also
be grown as border plants, but succeed
best in open, sunny, rich, moist positions.
Crested irises, also rhizomatous, have
ridges, or cockscomb-like crests, instead
of beards. They include the Evansia irises,
with often widely spreading, creeping
stolons. Most have very similar cultivation
requirements to bearded irises but some
prefer damp, rich conditions.
Bulbous These irises are distinguished by
having bulbs as storage organs, sometimes
with thickened, fleshy roots, and leaves that
are lance-shaped and channeled; 4-sided

IRIS
(more or less square in cross section); or
almost cylindrical—unlike the flat and
usually sword-shaped leaves of the
rhizomatous irises. Xiphium irises include
the commonly grown Spanish, English and
Dutch irises, which are excellent both for
garden decoration and as cut flowers. All
are easy to cultivate in sunny, well-drained
sites, preferring slightly alkaline conditions,
but also growing well on acidic soil.
Spanish irises are derived from I. xiphium,
which is variable in flower color, from blue
and violet to yellow and white, and
produces its channeled leaves in fall.
English irises have been produced from
I. latifolia, which varies from blue to violet
(occasionally white) and produces its
channeled leaves in spring. Dutch irises
are hybrids of I. xiphium and the related
pale to deep blue I. latifolia. They are
extremely variable in flower color. Juno
irises have bulbs with thickened, fleshy
roots, channeled leaves and very small
standards that are sometimes only bristly
and usually horizontally placed. Although
very beautiful in flower, they are mostly
difficult to grow successfully, requiring the
same cultivation conditions as Oncocyclus
irises to thrive. Care must be taken not
to damage the fleshy roots when
transplanting or dividing clumps.
Reticulata irises include the dwarf,
bulbous irises valuable for flowering early
in the year. Unlike other bulbous irises,
they have netlike bulb tunics and leaves
that are 4-sided, or occasionally cylindrical.
With few exceptions (not described here),
Reticulata irises grow well in open, sunny,
well-drained sites.

6 petals strongly reflexed to form a
turkscap shape. (Petals of Lilium are known
botanically as perianth segments.) Three
categories of flower size—small, medium
and large—are used in the descriptions
below. For turkscap, bowl-, cup-, and starshaped
flowers: small is up to 2in (5cm)
across; medium is 2–3in (5–7cm) across;
large is over 3in (7cm) across. For trumpetand
funnel-shaped flowers: small is up to
3in (7cm) long; medium is 3–4in (7–10cm)
long; large is over 4in (10cm) long. Each
plant has a spread of up to 12in (30cm).
Needs sun and well-drained soil, unless
otherwise stated. Propagate by seed in fall
or spring, by bulb scales in summer or by
stem bulbils in fall. Virus, fungal diseases,
and lily beetle may cause problems. Lilies
are classified into 9 divisions. See feature
panel pp.388–91.
Division 1 (Asiatic hybrids)
These lilies are derived from various Asiatic
species, including L. bulbiferum, L.
cernuum, L. concolor, L. davidii, L.
lancifolium and L. x maculatum. The flowers
are borne in racemes or umbels, and are
usually unscented. The leaves are narrowly
ovate and arranged alternatively. There are
3 subdivisions: 1a) upward-facing flowers;
1b) outward-facing flowers; 1c) pendent
flowers.
Division 2 (Martagon hybrids)
Derived primarily from L. hansonii and L.
martagon, these lilies produce racemes of
turkscap, sometimes scented flowers, and
have whorls of elliptic leaves.
Division 3 (Candidum hybrids)
Derived from L. candicum and other
European species, except L. martagon,
these lilies produce sometimes scented,
mostly turkscap flowers, singly or in
umbels or racemes. Leaves are elliptic,
and spirally arranged or scattered.
Division 4 (American hybrids)
Derived from American species, these lilies
bear racemes of sometimes scented, mostly
turkscap, but occasionally funnel-shaped
flowers, and have whorls of lance-shaped
to elliptic leaves.
Division 5 (Longiflorum hybrids)
Derived from L. formosanum and L.
longiflorum, these lilies bear racemes or
umbels of large, often sweetly scented,
trumpet- or funnel-shaped flowers,
sometimes only 2 or 3 per stem. Leaves
are linear to narrowly lance-shaped, and
scattered.
Division 6 (Trumpet and Aurelian
hybrids)
Derived from Asiatic species, including
L. regale, L. henryi and L. sargentiae, these
lilies bear racemes or umbels of usually
scented flowers. Leaves are elliptic to linear,
and alternate or spirally arranged. There are
4 subdivisions: 6a) trumpet-shaped flowers;
6b) bowl-shaped flowers; 6c) very shallowly
bowl-shaped flowers, some almost flat; 6d)
distinctly recurved flowers.
Division 7 (Oriental hybrids)
Derived from E. Asian species, such as
L. auratum, L. japonicum and L. speciosum,
as well as their hybrids with L. henryi,
these lilies have flowers borne in racemes
or panicles, and are often scented. Leaves
are lance-shaped and alternate. There are 4
subdivisions: 7a) trumpet-shaped flowers;
7b) bowl-shaped flowers; 7c) flat or very
shallowly bowl-shaped flowers; 7d)
turkscap or various recurved flowers.

Daffodil
AMARYLLIDACEAE
Genus of bulbs, grown for their flowers.
Daffodils have usually linear, basal leaves
and a spread of up to 8in (20cm). Each
flower has a trumpet or cup and petals
(botanically known as perianth segments).
Prefers sun or partial shade and welldrained
soil, but Div.8 cultivars (see below)
prefer a sunny site and tolerate lighter
soils. Deadhead flowers and remove the
faded foliage in mid-summer. Most
cultivars increase naturally by offsets;
dense clumps should be divided no sooner
than 6 weeks after flowering every 3–5
years. Propagate species by seed when
fresh, in late summer or fall. Narcissus
yellow stripe virus, basal rot, slugs, large
narcissus fly and bulb and stem eelworm
may cause problems. T Contact with the
sap of daffodils may irritate skin or
aggravate skin allergies. Horticulturally,
Narcissus is split into the following
divisions (see also feature panel pp.404–05).
Div.1 Trumpet—usually solitary flowers
each have a trumpet that is as long as, or
longer than, the petals. Early to late springflowering.
Div.2 Large cupped—solitary flowers
each have a cup at least one-third the
length of, but shorter than, the petals.
Spring-flowering.
Div.3 Small-cupped—flowers are
often borne singly; each has a cup not
more than one-third the length of the
petals. Spring- or early summer-flowering.
Div.4 Double—most have solitary, large,
fully or semidouble flowers, sometimes
scented, with both cup and petals or cup
alone replaced by petaloid structures. Some
have smaller flowers, produced in clusters
of 4 or more, which are often sweetly
fragrant. Spring- or early summerflowering.
Div.5 Triandrus—nodding flowers, with
short, sometimes straight-sided cups and
narrow, reflexed petals, are borne 2–6 per
stem. Flowers are produced in spring.
Div.6 Cyclamineus—flowers are borne
usually 1 or 2 per stem, each with a cup

N
NARCISSUS
sometimes flanged and often longer than
those of Div.5. Petals are narrow, pointed
and reflexed. Early to mid-spring-flowering.
Div.7 Jonquil and Apodanthus—
sweetly scented flowers are borne usually 2
or more per stem. Cup is short, sometimes
flanged; petals are often flat, fairly broad
and rounded. Spring-flowering.
Div.8 Tazetta—sweetly fragrant flowers
of small-flowered cultivars are borne in
clusters of 12 or more per stem; largeflowered
cultivars have 3 or 4 flowers per
stem. All have a small, often straight-sided
cup and broad, mostly pointed petals. Late
fall- to mid-spring-flowering. Fallflowering
hybrids provide valuable cut
flowers; “prepared” bulbs may be grown
in pots for mid-winter flowering.
Div.9 Poeticus—flowers, sometimes
borne 2 per stem, may be sweetly fragrant.
Each has a small, colored cup and
glistening white petals. Some N. poeticus
hybrids are categorized as Div.3 or 8.
Late spring- or early summer-flowering.
Div.10 Bulbocodium—flowers usually
borne singly on very short stems, showing
all the hallmarks of hoop-petticoat daffodils
(N. bulbocodium subsp. bulbocodium),
with insignificant petals and a
disproportionately large, widely flaring
cup. Winter- to spring-flowering.
Div.11 Split-corona—usually solitary
flowers that have cups split for more than
half their length. In (a), Collar daffodils, the
overlapping segments of the cup lie against
the petals, but in (b), Papillon daffodils, the
segments of the cup tend to be narrower,
with their tips arranged at the margin of
the petals. Most flowers fall into category
(a). Spring-flowering.
Div.12 Miscellaneous—a miscellaneous
category containing hybrids with varying,
intermediate flower shapes that cannot be
satisfactorily classified elsewhere. Fall- to
spring-flowering.
Div.13 Daffodils distinguished solely
by botanical name—a wide variety of
flowers showing the huge range of floral
characteristics of wild daffodils, from the
tiny N. cyclamineus and the sweetly
scented, many-flowered N. tazetta to the
stately trumpet species. Flower in early fall
to early summer.

ORCHIDS
ORCHIDACEAE
Family of perennials, some of which are
evergreen or semievergreen, grown for
their unusual flowers. These consist of
3 outer sepals and 3 inner petals, the
lowest of which, known as the lip, is usually
enlarged and different from the others in
shape, markings and color. There are about
750 genera and 22,500 species, together
with an even greater number of hybrids,
bred partly for their vigor and ease of
care. They are divided into epiphytic and
terrestrial plants. (The spread of an orchid
is indefinite.)
Epiphytic orchids
Epiphytes have more flamboyant flowers
than terrestrial orchids and are more
commonly grown. In the wild, they grow
on tree branches or rocks (lithophytes),
obtaining nourishment through clinging
roots and moisture through aerial roots.
Most consist of a horizontal rhizome, from
which arise vertical, water-storing, often
swollen stems known as pseudobulbs.
Flowers and foliage are produced from
the newest pseudobulbs. Other epiphytes
consist of a continuously growing upright
rhizome; on these, flower spikes appear
in the axils of leaves growing from the
rhizome. In temperate climates, epiphytes
need to be grown under glass.
Cultivation of epiphytes
For cultivation purposes, epiphytes, which
are all tender (they cannot withstand
freezing temperatures), may be divided
into three groups: cool-greenhouse types,
which require min. 50°F (10°C) and max.
75°F (24°C); intermediate-greenhouse
types, needing a range of 55–80°F
(13–27°C); and warm-greenhouse types,
requiring 65–80°F (18–27°C). In summer,
temperatures need to be controlled by
shading the glass and by ventilation.
Cool-greenhouse orchids may be placed
outdoors in summer; this improves
flowering. Other types may also be grown
outdoors if the air temperature remains
within these ranges.
The amount of light required in summer
is given in individual plant entries.
All epiphytic orchids, however, need
to be kept out of direct sun in summer
to avoid scorching, and require full
light in winter.
Epiphytic orchids, whether grown
indoors or outside, require a special soilfree
compost obtained from an orchid
nursery or made by mixing 2 parts fibrous
material (such as bark chippings and/or
peat) with 1 part porous material (such as
moss and/or expanded clay pellets). Most
epiphytes may be grown in pots, although
some may be successfully cultivated in a
hanging basket or on a slab of bark (with
moss around their roots) suspended in the
greenhouse.
In summer, water plants freely and spray
regularly. Those suspended on bark slabs
need a constantly moist atmosphere. In
winter, water moderately and, if plants
are in growth, spray occasionally. Some
orchids rest in winter and require scarcely
any water or none at all. Orchids benefit
from weak foliar feeds; apply as for
watering. Repot plants every other year,
in spring; if they are about to flower, repot
after flowering.
Terrestrial orchids
Terrestrial orchids, some of which also
produce pseudobulbs, grow in soil or
leaf mold, sustaining themselves in the
normal way through roots or tubers.
Some may be grown in borders, but many
in temperate climates need to be cultivated
in pots and protected under glass in winter.
Cultivation of terrestrial orchids
Terrestrial orchids are hardy to tender, min.

O
OSBECKIA
65°F (18°C). Cypripedium species may be
grown outdoors in any area, preferably in
neutral to acid soil, but cannot withstand
severe frost, if frozen solid in pots or
without snow cover, or tolerate very wet
soil in winter. Other terrestrial orchids,
except in very mild areas, are best grown
in pots; use the same compost as for
epiphytes but add 1 part grit to 2 parts
compost. Place pots outdoors in a peat bed
or in a glasshouse in the growing season.
Keep dry when dormant. Under glass,
light requirements, watering, feeding
and repotting are as for epiphytes.
Orchid propagation
Orchids with pseudobulbs may be
increased by removing and replanting
old, leafless pseudobulbs when repotting
in spring. Take care to retain at least
4 pseudobulbs on the parent plant. Some
genera that may be propagated in this
way are: Ada, x Aliceara, Anguloa, Bletilla,
Brassavola (large plants only and retaining
at least 6 pseudobulbs on the parent),
x Brassocattleya, Bulbophyllum, Calanthe,
Cattleya, Coelogyne, Cymbidium,
Dendrobium, Dendrochilum, Encyclia,
Gomesa, Gongora, Laelia, Lycaste,
Maxillariella, Miltonia, Miltoniopsis,
Oncidium, Phaius, Pleione, Stanhopea
and Zygopetalum.
Some orchids without pseudobulbs
produce new growth from the base.
When a plant has 6 new growths, divide
it in spring into 2 and repot both portions.
Propagate Disa, Paphiopedilum and
Phragmipedium in this way. Large
specimens of Eria and Masdevallia may
be divided in spring, leaving 4–6 stems
on each portion.
Propagation of Phalaenopsis is by stem
cuttings taken soon after flowering.
Vanda may be increased by removing
the top half of the stem once it has
produced aerial roots and leaves; new
growths will develop from the leafless
base. With both these methods, achieving
success is difficult and not recommended
for the beginner.
Propagate terrestrial orchids with tubers
by division of the tubers. Genera that may
be increased in this way are: Cypripedium
(in spring), Dactylorhiza (spring), Ophrys
(fall), Serapias (fall) and Spiranthes (spring).
Calypso is rarely propagated successfully
in cultivation. Angraecum should not be
propagated in cultivation, because the
parent plant is easily endangered.
Propagate Ponerorchis by small tubers that
form around the base of the stem, when
repotting tubers before growth commences
in early spring. Seedlings may appear in
the compost around the parent plant.
The most easily increased orchids are
Cymbidium. Propagation of Epidendrum
may be extremely difficult; see genus for
specific details.
Orchids are illustrated on pp.466–67.

Flower forms
Unless stated otherwise, peonies described
below flower between late spring and early
to mid-summer and have large, alternate
leaves divided into oval to lance-shaped or
linear leaflets. Flowers are single,
semidouble, double or anemone-form.
Single—flowers are mostly cup-shaped,
with 1 or 2 rows of large, often lightly
ruffled, incurving petals and a conspicuous
central boss of stamens.
Semidouble—flowers are similar to single
ones, but have 2 or 3 rows of petals.
Double—flowers are rounded, usually
composed of 1 or 2 outer rows of large,
often lightly ruffled, incurving petals, the
remaining petals being smaller, usually
becoming more densely arranged and
diminishing in size toward the center.
Stamens are few, inconspicuous or absent.
Anemone-form (Imperial or Japanese)—
flowers usually have 1 or 2 rows of broad,
incurving, outer petals; the center of the
flower is often filled entirely with numerous
densely arranged, sometimes deeply cut,
narrow petaloids derived from stamens.

PELARGONIUM
Geranium
GERANIACEAE
Genus of mainly summer-flowering
perennials, most of which are evergreen,
often cultivated as annuals. Is grown for
its colorful flowers and is useful in pots
or as bedding plants; in warm conditions,

frequently and fertilize regularly if grown
in containers; do not overwater. Plants may
be kept through winter in the greenhouse
by cutting back in fall–winter to 5in (12cm)
and repotting. Propagate by softwood
cuttings from spring to fall. T Contact
with the foliage may occasionally aggravate
skin allergies.
Pelargoniums may be divided into six
groups; all flower in summer–fall unless
stated otherwise. See also feature panel
p.309.
Angel—plants with rounded, sometimes
scented, usually mid-green leaves, and
clusters of small, single flowers of the
regal type.
Ivy-leaved—trailing, evergreen plants,
ideal for hanging baskets, with lobed,
sometimes pointed, stiff, fleshy, usually
mid-green leaves and flowers similar to
those of zonal pelargoniums.
Regal—shrubby, evergreen plants with
rounded, sometimes lobed or partially
toothed, mid-green leaves and clusters
of single, rarely double, broadly trumpetshaped,
exotic-colored flowers that are
prone to weather damage in the open.
Scented-leaved and species—evergreen
plants with small, single, often irregularly
star-shaped flowers; scented-leaved forms
are grown for their fragrance.
Unique—Tall-growing, evergreen
subshrubs with rounded or lobed,
sometimes incised, mid-green leaves,

PRIMULA
Primrose
PRIMULACEAE
Genus of mainly herbaceous perennials,
some woody-based and evergreen. All have
leaves in basal rosettes and tubular, bell- or
primrose-shaped flowers. In some primulas,
the flower stems, leaves, sepals and,
occasionally, sections of the petals are
covered with a waxy powder known as
farina. There are primulas suitable for
almost every type of site: the border, scree
garden, rock garden, peat garden, bog
garden, pond margin, greenhouse and
alpine house. Some may be difficult to grow
as they dislike winter damp or summer
heat. Repot pot-grown plants annually.
Tidy up fading foliage and deadhead as
flowering ceases. Propagate species by seed
when fresh or in spring, selected forms
when dormant, by division in fall–spring
or by root cuttings in winter, auricula
primulas by offsets in early spring or early
fall. Border cultivars may be prone to slug
damage in damp places and to attack by
root aphids when grown in very dry
conditions or in pots. Primulas are divided
into many different horticultural groups,
of which the following are in common use.
See also feature panel pp.258–9.
Auricula primulas
These are evergreen primulas, derived
from hybrids between P. auricula and
P. hirsuta, producing flat, smooth flowers
carried in an umbel on a stem above the
foliage. There are 3 main subgroups:
alpine, show and border.
Alpine Auricula Group. In these, the
color of the flower center is strikingly
different from that of the petals. They may
be either light-centered (white or pale in
the center) or gold-centered (yellow or gold
in the center). There is no meal or “farina”
on either leaves or flowers. Grow in an
alpine house or rock garden.
Show Auricula Group has flowers with
a distinct circle of white meal or “paste” in
the center. Some are self-colored, with one
color, which may be red, yellow, blue or
violet, from the central paste to the petal
margins; edged cultivars have a black ring
surrounding the central paste, feathering
out to an often green, gray or white
margin; in fancy cultivars, the paste is
surrounded by a color other than black,
with a green, gray or white margin. Show
Auriculas have white farina on their foliage
(except those with green-edged flowers),
on their flower eyes and, sometimes, on
their petal margins. Grow under glass to
protect flowers from rain.
Border Auricula Group has generally
robust, garden Auricula primulas, which
are often very fragrant. Some have farina
on flower stems and leaves. Grow in a
mixed or herbaceous border.
Candelabra primulas
These are robust, herbaceous perennials
with tubular, flat-faced flowers borne in
tiered whorls up tall, sturdy stems. Some
are deciduous, dying back to basal buds;
others are semievergreen, dying back to
reduced rosettes. Grow in moist shade or
woodland, especially by streams.
Primrose-Polyanthus primulas
A diverse group of evergreen,
semievergreen or deciduous perennial
hybrids, derived from P. vulgaris, crossed
with P. veris, P. juliae and other species.
They are divided into two main groups.
Primrose Group Most produce solitary
flowers among the leaves. Are mainly
grown as herbaceous perennials, flowering
in spring, or as biennial greenhouse
container plants flowering in winterspring.
Polyanthus Group Produce flowers
in long-stalked umbels. Usually grown as
biennials for bedding, sown in summer to
flower in winter and the following spring,
or under glass as winter- and springflowering
container plants.
Cultivation
Primulas have varying cultivation
requirements. For ease of reference, these
have been grouped as follows:
1—Full sun or partial shade, in moist, but
well-drained, rich soil.
2—Partial shade, in deep, rich, moist,
neutral to acidic soil.
3—Deep or partial shade, in peaty, gritty,
moist but very well-drained, acidic soil.
Protect from excessive winter wet.
4—Under glass in an alpine house or
frame. Avoid wetting foliage of mealy
species and hybrids.
5—Full sun with some midday shade,
or partial shade, in rich, moist but welldrained,
gritty, slightly alkaline soil.
6—In a cool or temperate greenhouse,
or as a houseplant, in bright, filtered light.

ROSACEAE
Genus of deciduous or evergreen shrubs
and trees. The trees are grown mainly for
their single (5-petaled) to double flowers
and fall color; the shrubs for their fall color,
bark, flowers or fruits. All have oval to
oblong leaves. Evergreen species need sun
or partial shade; deciduous species prefer
full sun. All may be grown in any but
waterlogged soil. Trim deciduous hedges
after flowering, evergreen ones in early or
mid-spring. Propagate deciduous species
by seed in fall, deciduous hybrids and
selected forms by softwood cuttings in
summer, evergreens by semiripe cuttings
in summer. Birds may eat flower buds and
foliage may be attacked by aphids,
caterpillars and the fungal disease silver
leaf. Flowering cherries are prone to a
fungus that causes “witches’ brooms”
(abnormal, crowded shoots). Certain
Prunus species and cultivars, notably
cultivars of the almond (P. dulcis) and the
peach (P. persica), are grown for their
edible fruits. T Leaves and fruits of most
other species may cause severe discomfort

RHODODENDRON
ERICACEAE
Genus of evergreen, semievergreen or
deciduous shrubs, ranging from a dwarf
habit to a treelike stature, grown mainly
for beauty of flower. Most prefer dappled
shade, but a considerable number tolerates
full sun, especially in cool climates. Needs
neutral to acid soil—ideally, rich and welldrained.
Shallow planting is essential, as
plants are surface-rooting. Deadhead spent
flowers, wherever practical, to encourage
energy into growth rather than seed
production. Propagate by layering or
semiripe cuttings in late summer. Yellowing
leaves are usually caused by poor drainage,
excessively deep planting or lime in soil.
Weevils and powdery mildew may also
cause problems. T The nectar of some
rhododendron flowers may cause severe
discomfort if ingested. See also feature
panel pp.124–125.
Rhododendrons and azaleas
The genus Rhododendron includes not
only evergreen, large-leaved and frequently
large-flowered species and hybrids, but
also dwarf, smaller-leaved shrubs, both
evergreen and deciduous, with fewflowered
clusters of usually small blooms.
“Azalea” is the common name given to the
deciduous species and hybrids, as well as
to a group of compact, evergreen shrubs
derived mainly from Japanese species.
They are valued for their mass of small
colorful blooms produced in late spring.
Many of the evergreen azaleas (sometimes
known as Belgian azaleas) may also
be grown as houseplants. Botanically,
however, all are classified as
Rhododendron. The flowers are usually
single, but may be semidouble or double,
including hose-in-hose (one flower tube
inside the other). Unless otherwise stated
below, flowers are single and leaves midto
dark green and oval.

ROSA
Rose
ROSACEAE
Genus of deciduous or semievergreen,
open shrubs and scrambling climbers,
grown for their profusion of flowers, often
fragrant, and sometimes for their fruits
(rose hips). Leaves are divided into usually
5 or 7 oval leaflets, with rounded or
pointed tips, that are sometimes toothed.
Stems usually bear thorns, or prickles.
Most of the bush and climbing roses grow
well in Z5–9 H9–5 (unless otherwise stated)
but are often grown in colder zones and
protected for the winter by mounding,
deep planting, or burying. Prefers an open,
sunny site and requires fertile, moist but
well-drained soil. Avoid planting in an area
where roses have been grown in recent
years, as problems due to harmful
organisms may occur: either exchange
the soil, which may be used satisfactorily
elsewhere, or choose another site for the
new rose. To obtain blooms of high quality,
feed in late winter or early spring with a
balanced fertilizer and apply a mulch. In
spring and summer, feed regularly at
3-weekly intervals. Remove spent flower
heads from plants that are “remontant”
(“rising up again”; other terms used are
repeat- or perpetual-flowering). May be
trimmed for tidiness in early winter. To
improve health, flower quality and shape
of bush, prune in the dormant season or,
preferably, in early spring, before young
shoots develop from dormant growth
buds: remove dead, damaged and dying
wood; lightly trim Old Garden and
Groundcover roses (see below); remove
two-thirds of previous summer’s growth of
Modern bush, including miniature, roses.
Correct treatment of Modern shrub and
climbing roses, ramblers and Species roses
depends on the individual cultivar, but in
general they should be pruned only lightly.
Propagate by budding in summer or by
hardwood cuttings in fall. All roses are
prone to attack by various pests and
diseases, including aphids, blackspot,
powdery mildew, rust and sawfly.
Rose species and cultivars are often
regarded as 2 separate groups. Cultivars
are farther divided into Old Garden and
Modern roses. Each group comprises
different types, based, it is claimed, on the
functional qualities of each plant, such as
whether it is repeat-flowering, rather than
on any historical, botanical or genetical
relationships. Flowers occur in a variety of
forms (illustrated and described on p.172).
and are single (4–7 petals), semidouble
(8–20 petals), double (20–30 petals) or fully
double (over 30 petals). Many modern rose
cultivars are sold under names other than
the registered Plant Breeder’s Rights (PBR)
names; where this is the case, the plant is
listed under its trade name, with the PBR
name in brackets afterwards. Roses are
illustrated on pp.172–187.
Species roses
Species, or wild, roses (including those
interspecific hybrids that share most of
the characteristics of their parent species)
are either shrubs or climbers, mostly
bearing single, 5-petaled, often fragrant
flowers in summer, usually in one flush
on short shoots from second-year wood;
the flowers are followed by red or black
hips in fall.
Old Garden roses
This category is so large that it is divided
into two groups. Roses in Group A are
mostly of European origin, while those
in Group B are hybrids between Oriental
and European roses.
Group A
Alba—large, freely branching shrubs with
only a few prickles on the stems. They
bear clusters of 5–7 semi- to fully double,
scented flowers in mid-summer, on shoots
from second-year wood. Have abundant,
grayish-green leaves. Most are good for
borders and as hedges or as specimen
plants.
Centifolia (or Provence)—lax, thorny
shrubs that produce often scented, double
to fully double flowers, borne singly or in
3s, in summer, on shoots from second-year
wood. Leaves are matt, dark green. Are
suitable for borders.
Damask—open shrubs with prickly stems
and downy leaves. They produce often
very fragrant, semi- to fully double flowers,
borne singly or in loose clusters of 5–7
mainly in summer, on shoots from secondyear
wood; a few also flower on new wood
in fall. Are suitable for borders or training
against a support.
Gallica—shrubs of fairly dense, freebranching
habit, with usually thorny
stems, and mostly dull, dark green leaves.
Produce mostly scented, single to fully
double, richly colored flowers, often in
clusters of 3, in summer on shoots from
second-year wood. Are suitable for
borders and as hedging.
Moss—often lax shrubs with a furry,
mosslike growth on stems and calyces.
Leaves are usually dark green. Usually
fragrant, semi- to fully double flowers,
often in clusters of 3 or more, are borne
on very thorny shoots from second-year
wood in summer. Are suitable for beds
and borders.
Scots (or Scotch)—suckering shrubs,
selections or hybrids of R. spinosissima,
of low, spreading, rarely upright habit,
with prickly stems and dark green leaves.
Occasionally scented, single to double
flowers are solitary or borne in clusters
of 3 or more, on short stems from secondyear
wood, usually in early summer. Are
suitable for beds and borders.
Sweet Briar—vigorous, free-branching
shrubs with usually thorny stems and
sweetly scented, dark green leaves. In
summer, they bear usually scented, single
to double flowers, singly or in clusters of
up to 7, on short shoots from second-year
wood. Use as hedges, as specimen plants
and in large borders.
Group B
Bourbon—large, open, repeat-flowering
shrubs and climbing roses, often with long,
smooth or prickly stems, which may be
trained to climb. They have often glossy
leaves and numerous scented, double or
fully double flowers, borne commonly in
3s, in flushes in summer and usually fall.
Flowers are borne on short shoots from
second-year wood and on new wood. Are
suitable for borders and for training over
fences, walls and pillars.
Boursault—climbing roses with long,
arching, usually smooth stems and dark
green leaves. They bear slightly scented,
semidouble or double flowers, singly or
in clusters of 3, in early summer, on short
shoots from second-year wood. Are
suitable for sheltered walls and fences.
China—spindly, repeat-flowering shrubs
with mostly smooth stems, bearing only
a few reddish-brown prickles, and glossy
leaves. They produce sometimes scented,
single to fully double flowers, singly or in
clusters of 3–13, in flushes in summer–fall.
Flowers appear on short shoots from
second-year wood and on new wood.
Need a sheltered site. Are suitable for
borders and walls.
Hybrid Musk—vigorous, repeatflowering
shrubs with prickly stems and
abundant foliage. They produce mainly
double blooms, often very fragrant, either
singly or in clusters of 2–7 or more, in
flushes from mid-summer to fall. Are good
for shrub borders, and can be trained on
walls.
Hybrid Perpetual—free-branching,
repeat-flowering shrubs with upright,
prickly growth and dark green leaves. They
bear often scented, fully double flowers,
held singly or in 3s, in flushes in summer–
fall on shoots from second-year wood and
on new wood. Are suitable for beds and
borders.
Noisette—repeat-flowering climbing roses
that bear clusters of 3–15 usually double
to fully double flowers, with a slight spicy
fragrance, in flushes in summer–fall.

naturalizing or for growing on fences and
pergolas.
Tea—repeat-flowering shrubs and
climbing roses with smooth to thorny
stems, sometimes bearing a few large,
red prickles, and glossy, light or sometimes
dark green leaves. They produce spicyscented,
slender-stemmed, semi- to fully
double flowers, borne singly or in 3s, in
flushes in summer–fall, on shoots from
second-year wood and on new wood. Need
a sheltered site. Are suitable for beds and
borders and trained against walls.
Modern roses
Climber—often vigorous climbing roses
with thorny, arching, stiff stems and usually
dense, glossy, mid- to dark green foliage.
They bear generally scented flowers in a
variety of forms, singly or in clusters of 3–7
or more. Some bloom in summer only, on
short shoots from second-year wood; many
are repeat-flowering and also flower on
new wood. Train against walls, fences or
use to cover garden structures.
Climbing Miniature—repeat-flowering,

SALIX
Willow
SALICACEAE
Genus of deciduous trees and shrubs, grown
for their habit, foliage, catkins and, in some
cases, colorful winter shoots. Male catkins
are more striking than female; each plant
usually bears catkins of only one sex. Most
prefer full sun. Most species grow well in
any but very dry soil; S. caprea, S. purpurea
and their variants also thrive in dry soil.
Plants grown for their colorful winter shoots
should be cut back hard in early spring,
every 1–3 years. Propagate by semiripe
cuttings in summer or by hardwood cuttings
in winter. Fungal diseases may cause canker,
particularly in S. babylonica and S. x
