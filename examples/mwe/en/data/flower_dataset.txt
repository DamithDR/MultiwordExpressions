summer-ﬂowering species. These, and cultivars that are not
fully hardy, are best planted against a sunny wall. Some
magnolias prefer acidic or neutral soil, but most tolerate
any soil provided it is humus-rich. Plenty of organic matter
should be dug into the soil before planting. Avoid planting
in exposed sites, as the ﬂowers can be damaged by frost.

Of the many ornamental features offered by trees, including
ﬂowers, fruit, and foliage, it is probably bark that makes the
greatest impact in a garden. This is partly because bark is
not transient and offers interest every day of the year and
throughout the mature life of the tree. Chosen carefully, trees
with ornamental bark can lighten up the darkest corner and
provide superb contrast to other plants. While maple (Acer),
birch (Betula), and cherry (Prunus) are obvious choices,
there are many other species with stunning, textured or
colored bark, such as the patterned stems of eucalyptus
and Stewartia. Some trees display their colorful bark from
an early age, others may take a few years to develop—but
the end result is well worth waiting for.

A genus of around 50 species of hardy plants, Cornus is
perhaps best known for its shrubby dogwoods, such as
Cornus alba ‘Sibirica’, which produce brightly colored winter
stems. However, the ﬂowering trees within this genus have
much to offer, as they are highly ornamental, ideal for small
gardens, and easy to grow—many accommodating a wide
range of soil types. The majority ﬂower in late spring or
early summer. Their “ﬂowers” consist of a rounded hub of
tiny blooms, surrounded by showy petal-like bracts, up to
3in (7.5cm) across on some cultivars, which range in color
from pure white, cream, and yellow to pink and red. In good
summers, attractive, edible, strawberry-like fruits develop
after ﬂowering. Several species, such as Cornus kousa,
also produce striking fall leaf color.

S. aucuparia tSORBUS
Comprising more than 100 hardy species, the genus Sorbus
includes a wide range of ornamental trees ideal for small to
medium-sized gardens. They provide a year-round display of
color and interest, with fragrant corymbs of cream ﬂowers,
attractive, divided foliage, vibrant fall color, and decorative
berrylike fruits that last well into winter on some species.
Most members of this genus fall into one of two categories: the
Aucuparia group, which has pinnate leaves like rowan (Sorbus
aucuparia), and the Aria group, which has rounded or oval leaves,
such as whitebeam (Sorbus aria). Virtually all species are easy
to grow and thrive in full sun or dappled shade, and in well-
drained, fertile, acidic or alkaline soil , although species within
the Aucuparia group are not long-lived on shallow alkaline soils.

The common holly, Ilex aquifolium, is one of the best-known
evergreen trees, but many other Ilex cultivars make attractive
garden plants. In size they range from tall specimen trees
to small shrubs. Leaves may be smooth-edged or spiny
and vary in color, several having gold, yellow, cream,
white, or gray variegation. Small, often white, male and
female ﬂowers, borne on separate plants during summer,
are followed by red, yellow, or black berries. In almost all
cases, hollies are unisexual—that is, the berries are borne
on female plants—soto obtain fruits it is usually necessary
to grow plants of both sexes. When choosing, don’t rely
on variety names to sex plants; I. aquifolium ‘Silver Queen’
is male. Hollies respond well to pruning and many
can be clipped to form hedges.

Dwarf conifers are valuable plants, especially for the small
garden, requiring little attention and providing year-round
interest. They can be planted as features in their own right,
for their varied shapes, habits, and often striking colors,
or, in the rock garden, to provide scale or act as a foil for
other plants such as bulbs. Several species and cultivars
are spreaders and good for groundcover. Most conifers
are suited to a wide range of growing conditions, although
Cedrus and Juniperus do not tolerate shade, and Juniperus
and Pinus are best for dry, sandy soils. Some species may
be clipped to form a low hedge, but new growth seldom
occurs from wood more than 3 or 4 years old. Dwarf
conifers also make excellent container plants.
 SHRUBS
Shrubs are key to any planting design, and provide color
and interest throughout the seasons with their wide variety
of foliage, flowers, fruits, and stems. Create a year-round
display with a selection of beautiful spring- and summer-
flowering shrubs, such as weigelas, buddlejas, and philadelphus,
together with those that sport brightly colored fall fruits, such as
pyracanthas and cotoneasters. You can then include witch hazels
and some species of honeysuckle to brighten bleak winter
months with their fragrant flowers. Whatever the size
or style of your garden, the permanent woody structure of
shrubs will form the framework, so make your selection and
plant them before the perennials. Some shrubs are also
ideal plants for hedges, enclosures, and screens.
108Star performers, shrubs form the backbone of many garden designs.
They can be used together in shrub borders or with other plant groups
in mixed displays. Providing color and interest with their foliage,
flowers, and fruits, many also offer scented blooms and colorful stems. SHRUBS
What are shrubs?
Shrubs are woody-stemmed, deciduous or
evergreen plants that branch out at or near
ground level. Some can grow to more than
20ft (6m) in height, although most attain less
than half this size. Leaves come in many
forms, from large and glossy to gray and
needlelike. There is sometimes an overlap
between shrubs and trees because larger
shrubs, such as flowering dogwoods
(Cornus species), can be grown on a single
stem. Subshrubs are another anomaly,
with woody stems at the base, but softer
top growth that may die back over winter
in colder regions, like a perennial. Examples
include ceratostigmas and fuchsias.
Choosing shrubs
When selecting shrubs, focus on those
whose needs match your garden conditions.
In general, shrubs with large, dark green
leaves require shade; plants with gray
foliage, such as lavender, require sun; and
shrubs with colorful leaves need full sun
or partial shade. Also consider the shrub’s
size and site it where it has space to mature,
unless you are planning a topiary display. Designing with shrubs
When creating a shrub display, try to
combine plants with different shapes,
habits, flower seasons, and foliage forms
and patterns to create a visually balanced
scheme and year-round interest. Knit them
together in a shrub bed, or use them to
provide a backdrop to more transient
displays of bulbs, perennials, and annuals
in a mixed border.
The shape and habit of shrubs provides
a design with structure and form. Contrast
low, spreading, prostrate or mat-forming
shrubs, such as Juniperus procumbens and
Cotoneaster horizontalis, with more upright
forms, such as Rosmarinus officinalis ‘Miss
Jessopp’s Upright’, and the rounded shapes
of bushy shrubs like hebes, skimmias,
or boxwood topiary. Mix in shrubs with
tiered branch structures, such as Viburnum
plicatum ‘Mariesii’, which provide strong
horizontal lines in a scheme. Graceful,
arching shrubs, such as Kolkwitzia amabilis,
Buddleja alternifolia, and Genista tenera
‘Golden Shower’ add an elegant note.
A wide range of shrubs are suitable for
creating hedges, enclosures, or screens.

2  Make final pruning cuts
Prune out any remaining
crossing stems. Once you have
cut back the tall growths, check
where you can make your ﬁnal
pruning cuts. Cut out the old
growths completely to leave
ﬁve or six strong young stems.1 Remove tall stems
Remove all dead and diseased
wood, taking it back to healthy growth.
Then prune back tall stems, removing
them a little at a time so that they
do not tear at the base. At this stage,
cut the stems to about 24in (60cm)
high, keeping in mind the plant’s
balanced shape as you prune.3 Cut back
remaining stems
Cut back the young healthy stems
that are left, so that they are 12–16in
(30–40cm) above the ground. The
ﬁnal cuts should be at an angle so
rainwater can run oﬀ. Later in the year,
a mass of young shoots will appear
along these stems (see left).
New growth after pruningRENOVATING A SHRUB
overall appearance will be much improved. Other shrubs that respond
well to this form of renovation include buddlejas, forsythias, kerrias, and
smoke trees (Cotinus). Some, such as rosemary and lavender, do not.When evergreens such as mahonias have outgrown their allotted space,
many can be cut back hard from mid-winter to early spring after ﬂowering.
The plant may not ﬂower for two years after such drastic pruning, but its Large Medium Small

(3m) (1.5–3m) (1.5m) SIZE CATEGORIES USED WITHIN THIS GROUP
 109As well as evergreen staples like boxwood
(Buxus), privet (Ligustrum), and shrubby
honeysuckle (Lonicera nitida), which
are commonly used, consider colorful
deciduous shrubs, like the prickly Berberis
thunbergii and its cultivars, or the
evergreen Photinia
x fraseri ‘Red Robin’,
which produces fiery young foliage in
spring and after clipping.
Certain shrubs are also ideal for topiary,
their small leaves lending themselves to
detailed shaping. Suitable shrubs include
boxwood and shrubby honeysuckle.
Shrubs such as fuchsias, hebes, fatsias,
and choisyas are ideal for containers.
Pots also limit the size of larger shrubs./ssmall/hsmall/rsmall/usmall/bsmall/ssmallKEEPING SHRUBS IN SHAPE
1 Assess your plant
In early summer, after daphnes have ﬂowered,
young leggy shoots sprout from the main stems.
Before cutting them back, take a look at the shrub
to see where to cut to produce a well-shaped plant. Many young plants and shrubs, such as
daphnes, produce long, leggy growths in spring
or early summer after ﬂowering. They do not
require major pruning, but a light trim will
produce a more compact, bushy shrub that
will be covered in ﬂowers the following year.
2 Shorten leggy growths
Using a pair of pruners, shorten the leggy
growths by 6–8in (15–20cm). It is important that
you always prune immediately above a leaf bud
with an angled, slanting cut, as shown above.
3 Work around the plant
Circle the plant, shortening each of the whippy
stems, and checking that you are maintaining a
good shape. The cut stems will then produce
bushier growth and more ﬂowers the following year.
Feast of berries
The bright red berries of a female Skimmia japonica,
produced where plants of both sexes are grown
together, persist well into winter. Spring pastels
Ceanothus flowers appear in late spring, decorating
the garden with various shades of blue and white.
These short-lived evergreens enjoy a warm, sunny site.ABOVE: Contrasting foliage
The golden leaves of Choisya ternata Sundance (‘Lich’)
provide a glowing contrast with the adjacent rich pink-
red Berberis thunbergii ‘Rose Glow’ and dark purple
Cotinus coggygria ‘Royal Purple’.Year-round interest
There is a shrub in flower almost every
month of the year. Interest begins in spring
with a range of colorful varieties, including
flowering currants (Ribes), ceanothus, and
rhododendrons. The display continues
with an abundance of summer-flowering
shrubs like fuchsias, hydrangeas, buddlejas,
and spiraeas, followed in fall by a range of
colorful berries offered by plants such as
pyracanthas, cotoneasters, and Skimmia
japonica. Many shrubs retain their fruits
into winter, providing birds and wildlife
with a much-needed supply of food.
As temperatures fall, the fragrant flowers
of witch hazel (Hamamelis), mahonias, and
winter box (Sarcococca) open, bringing
new interest to the garden. Combine these
with the vivid stems of coppiced dogwoods
(Cornus species) and variegated evergreens
for a dramatic winter scheme.

6m0BUDDLEJAS
Buddleja is genus of approximately 100 species of highly
ornamental evergreen and deciduous shrubs and small
trees, originating predominantly in Asia, Africa, and the
Americas. Buddlejas are often included in wildlife gardens
as they encourage increased insect activity, which has
earned one species the common name of butterﬂy bush,
although they all also attract bees and hoverﬂies. They
produce small, highly-scented, tubular ﬂowers borne in
either plume-shaped or globular clusters. Easy to grow,
they thrive in almost any soil, and perform best in a warm,
sunny position. They are particularly suitable for growing
against a south-facing wall.

S. komarowii subsp.reﬂexa S. vulgaris ‘Firmament’  LILACS
The heady scent of the lilac (Syringa)
epitomizes early summer. Apart from
the classic lilacs and mauves, colors
include white, pink, cream, and rich
red-purple; double forms are also
available. Most lilacs grown in gardens
are vigorous shrubs derived from
S. vulgaris. They may eventually become
treelike and are best planted at the back
of a shrub border. Spent ﬂower heads
should be removed, with care taken not
to damage the new shoots. Otherwise,
little pruning is required, though older
plants may be rejuvenated by hard
pruning in winter.

These evergreen shrubs and small
trees have long been valued for
their luxuriant, rich green foliage
and masses of showy ﬂowers, in
shades of white, pink, red, and
yellow, borne mainly in winter and
spring. Once thought suitable only
for greenhouses, many camellias
are hardy to Zone 6 if grown in
sheltered positions, although blooms
may suffer frost and rain damage.
Ideal for shady gardens, they grow
well against walls. Camellias require
acidic soil but also make good
container plants. The main ﬂower
forms are illustrated below.
Single—shallowly
cup-shaped ﬂowers
each have not more
than 8 petals, arranged
in a single row, and a
conspicuous, central
boss of stamens.
Semidouble—cup-
shaped ﬂowers each
have 2 or more rows
of 9–21 regular or
irregular petals, and
conspicuous stamens.
Anemone—rounded
ﬂowers each have one
or more rows of large,
outer petals lying ﬂat or
undulating; the domed
centre has a mass of
intermingled petaloids
and stamens.
Peony-form—
rounded, domed
ﬂowers have usually
irregular petals
intermingled with
petaloids and stamens.
Rose-form—cup-
shaped ﬂowers each
have several rows
of overlapping petals
and open to reveal
stamens in the centre.
Formal double—
rounded ﬂowers have
rows of regular, neatly
overlapping petals
that obscure stamens.
Irregular double
forms are similar but
often have more loosely
arranged, sometimes
irregular, petals.

Rhododendrons and azaleas both belong to the huge
genus Rhododendron, one of the largest in the plant
kingdom. Azalea is the common name used for all the
deciduous species and hybrids, and many of the dwarf,
small-leaved evergreens. In stature the genus ranges from
small alpine shrubs only a few inches high to tall, spreading
trees, in the wild reaching 80ft (24m). Rhododendrons
require well-drained, acidic soil rich in organic matter.
Most prefer cool woodland conditions, although many
dwarf forms thrive in more open sites. Many grow well in
containers, in which it is often easier to provide suitable
growing conditions. Once established, they require little
attention apart from an annual mulch and occasional
fertilizer, and provide a colorful display for years.

C. sanguinea ‘Midwinter Fire’ C. sericea ‘White Gold’ C. alba ‘Aurea’  CORNUS
Shrubby members of the genus Cornus are justiﬁably
popular among gardeners and landscape designers,
admired for their highly ornamental brightly colored
winter stems, ranging from lime green and yellow to
orange and crimson, as well as their spring ﬂowers,
and, in some cultivars, variegated foliage. Extremely
hardy, dogwoods tolerate extreme cold and exposure.
They also grow well on most soils, and require little
maintenance—simply cut back the stems to just above
the ground every two years in late winter. This promotes
young growth, which has the most vibrant color.

Valued for their late summer ﬂowers, hydrangeas
are versatile shrubs that thrive in a variety of situations.
Larger-growing species, some of which may become
treelike with age, are suited to light woodland, while the
range of cultivars, mostly of H. macrophylla, make excellent
border plants. Some may also be grown in containers.
Colors range from white through pink, red, and purple
to blue. The truest blue is obtained only on acidic soil.
Lacecap hydrangeas have a central corymb of small,
fertile ﬂowers surrounded by showy, colored bracts;
mopheads (or hortensias) have domed heads of sterile
bracts only. H. paniculata cultivars bear larger though
fewer cone-shaped ﬂower heads if pruned hard in spring.

Sarcococca confusa Cornus alba ‘Sibirica Variegata’ Poncirus trifoliata SHRUBS FOR BERRIES
Most plants produce seeds in one form or another, but
fruits and berries offer the best decorative value. Shrubs,
in particular, offer a huge variety of berries in a range of
colors, shapes, and sizes. Most appear from summer to
late fall, with many enduring well into winter, brightening
up the garden when color is in short supply, and providing
an excellent source of nutrition for birds and wildlife. The
most popular berried shrubs are cotoneaster, viburnum,
and the snowberry (Symphoricarpos), with more unusual
fruit produced by Clerodendrum trichotomum and Decaisnea
fargesii, among others. Many of these plants are easy to
grow, and will thrive in most soils, if given an annual
application of all-purpose granular fertilizer in spring.

in color from deep red and purple to soft pink and pure
white, and are often bicolored. Unlike tender varieties
(see p.302), hardy fuchsias can be grown outside down
to Zone 7 in full sun or partial shade. They require moist,
well-drained soil, and can be grown in large containers.

Salvia is a vast genus of 900 species of mainly tender
subshrubs or herbaceous perennials from North, Central,
and South America and Africa. Most species have aromatic
leaves and the foliage of common sage, Salvia ofﬁcinalis, has
been cultivated for centuries for culinary and medicinal use.
The ﬂowers of shrubby salvias, which are primarily white,
pink, or red, are hooded and borne in whorls along the
stems in summer and early fall. Most species are quite
tender and need winter protection in frost-prone areas,
although common sage and its cultivars are very hardy.
S. microphylla will also withstand a few degrees of frost,
but the others featured here are conservatory plants.
Grow garden salvias in free-draining soil and full sun.

Lavandula is a popular genus of about 25 species of
aromatic shrubs and herbs that originate predominantly
from the Mediterranean region and northeast Africa,
and thrive in hot, dry, sunny sites. Most have linear
silver-gray foliage and produce erect spikes of fragrant
ﬂowers in shades of white, pink, blue, or purple, depending
on the type. They are versatile plants, and can be used to
edge borders, paths, and hard landscaping, or against a
backdrop of stonework, as a dwarf hedge or informal divide,
or in association with roses for a typical “English style” effect.
They are also excellent plants for coastal areas, coping well
with salt-laden maritime breezes, and thrive in well-drained
soil; they will suffer if planted in shade or wet soil.

foliage, which often turns a deep burnt orange in winter,
while others ﬂower for a long period during summer,
fall, or winter. Flowers come in a variety of hues, and
are occasionally bicolored. In habit, heathers vary from
tree-heaths of up to 20ft (6m) to dwarf, prostrate forms,
many of which are excellent as groundcover. There are
three genera: Calluna, Daboecia, and Erica. All Calluna and

 ROSES
These most romantic of flowers are unsurpassed in beauty and
fragrance, and many people consider them indispensable
features of the garden. With some 150 species and thousands
of cultivars, both ancient and modern, there is a rose to suit
almost any situation. They come from a wide range of habitats
throughout the Northern Hemisphere and, with a few exceptions,
most roses in cultivation are very hardy. They are also extremely
versatile, and can be grown among bulbs, perennials, and other
shrubs in a mixed border or in a more traditional formal rose
garden. Climbing and rambling roses can be trained over
arches, arbors, and pergolas, creating a blanket of scented
blooms and beautiful foliage; or, if you have a small garden,
you can plant a patio rose or two in a container.
170Prized for their beauty and fragrance, roses are considered the most
romantic of flowers. They are indispensable in informal mixed planting
schemes, and add an elegant note to formal parterres. With thousands
of colors and forms to choose from, there is a rose for every garden.ROSES
ABOVE Container roses
Some roses have been bred specifically for containers,
such as the patio rose
REGENSBURG. Partner them with
trailing annuals, such as Sutera cordata (syn. Bacopa).
LEFT Formal dressing
Here, a sturdy arch clothed with clematis and a
vigorous, free-flowering rambler lends height to
the scheme and forms a perfect frame to draw the
eye to the sculpture used as a focal point./rsmall/osmall/ssmall/esmall/ssmallGrowing roses
With some 150 species and thousands of
cultivars, both ancient and modern, there
are members of the genus Rosa to suit an
enormous number of garden situations.
They come from a wide range of habitats
throughout the Northern Hemisphere and,
with few exceptions, most roses are very
hardy. Many modern roses combine the
best qualities of old roses, such as flower
shape and scent, with disease resistance
and extended flowering seasons.
When grown in a suitable site and soil,
they will repay you with a profusion of
blooms. All roses prefer an open, sunny
site in fertile, humus-rich, moist but well-
drained soil. However, avoid planting them
in an area where roses have been grown
before because the soil may be affected
by “rose sickness,” caused by a buildup of
harmful soil organisms, and plants may fail
to thrive. Roses also require a good supply of nutrients to perform well, and benefit
from an annual application of all-purpose
granular fertilizer in the spring.
Year-round interest
Although some roses, notably the climbers
and species, bloom for a relatively short
period, many hybrids are repeat-flowering,
providing a colorful display throughout
the summer. ‘Frühlingsmorgen’ offers
the first flush of flowers in early summer,
followed by the main flourish from mid-
summer to the first frost. To help maintain
this display, deadhead your roses regularly,
as this redirects the plant’s energy from
seed formation to flower production.
However, if you want attractive fruits (hips)
in the fall, leave the blooms to fade. The best
roses for hips include the Rugosa’s tomato-
like fruit, the flask-shaped, vibrant scarlet
fruits of R. moyesii, and the rounded, black
hips of R. pimpinellifolia.Ornamental features
Roses embrace almost every color of the
spectrum, apart from true blue, and some
have a strong fragrance, such as the heady,
sweet scent of the Damasks or musk and
spicy fragrances of many modern roses.
A few also have ornamental thorns, notably
R. sericea subsp. omeiensis f. pteracantha,
with large, triangular thorns that glow
bloodred when they are backlit.
Foliage can also provide interest. The
soft gray-purple leaves of R. glauca and
blue-green of the Alba roses provide
attractive foils for crimson and purple
flowers, while foliage textures, ranging
from glossy to matt, and delicate fernlike
to robustly wrinkled, as in R. rugosa,
create beautiful contrasts.
Designing with roses
Roses have a diversity of habits, each
of which can be used to create exciting
designs. These include mound-forming
groundcover roses, densely thorny
Gallicas, and the arching Chinas and
Damasks. A traditional rose garden laid
out in a formal style with geometrically
ordered beds is particularly suited to
the upright growth of many bush roses.
 171RIGHT Summer bedfellows
Alliums, bearded irises, campanulas, and verbascums
provide perfect companions to a profusion of scented
roses in a pink-and-blue-themed summer border.
Regular deadheading will prolong the show.
/rsmall/osmall/ssmall/esmall/ssmallIn contemporary schemes, shrub roses
are often grown among bulbs, perennials,
and other shrubs in a mixed border, but
when designing these displays, make sure
that neighboring plants do not compete
directly for moisture and nutrients. Choose
companions that are shallow-rooted, such as
the many herbaceous geraniums and pinks
(Dianthus cultivars), or space plants at a
sufficient distance to allow for mulching
and fertilizing around the rose’s root zone.
Climbing and rambling roses can be
trained on a wall as a colorful backdrop,
or on a trellis to form a screen. In addition,
they provide a cloak of flowers and foliage
when grown on arches and over arbors,
and make focal points on freestanding
features like tripods and pyramids. Large
rampant ramblers, such as R. ‘Bobbie
James’ and R. ‘Seagull’, which both can
achieve 30ft (10m) or more, will quickly
scramble through a tree, offering a
profusion of blooms just after most tree
blossoms have faded.
Many climbing roses are available as
weeping standards too. Tall cultivars of dense, thorny shrub roses, such as the
Rugosa roses, also make decorative
structural features. Use them to create
large impenetrable boundary hedges that
give privacy and security, or to divide up
a garden into compartments. Vigorous
groundcover roses are ideal for clothing
PRUNING BUSH AND SHRUB ROSES
Pruning floribunda roses
Also known as cluster-ﬂowered roses, ﬂoribundas
produce ﬂushes of blooms through summer and
early fall. In early spring, remove dead, diseased,
and crossing stems. Prune the other stems to
outward-facing buds 8–12in (20–30cm) from
the ground using sloping cuts. Aim to leave a
framework of 8 to 10 strong, healthy stems. Modern hybrid tea and ﬂoribunda roses, which are commonly grown
in gardens, need hard pruning in late winter or early spring to
encourage the production of new ﬂowering shoots. Shrub roses
require a more gentle pruning regimen. Roses also beneﬁt from a
light pruning in fall to prevent stems from blowing in the wind and
rocking the plant, which may result in root damage. Pruning in a
Pruning hybrid tea roses
These are large-ﬂowered roses, and include some
varieties that repeat bloom, although they produce
just one ﬂower per stem. In late winter or early spring,
cut the oldest stems to the ground, and shorten
the remainder to 6in (15cm) from the base. Leave
three to ﬁve strong young stems after pruning, and
angle cuts to allow water to drain oﬀ the buds.Pruning shrub and species roses
These usually ﬂower once on wood made in
previous years, so prune lightly in early spring.
Remove dead, damaged, or diseased wood, and
thin out congested growth to improve air ﬂow.
Also cut some of the oldest stems to the ground.
Cut main stems back by a quarter and slightly
reduce side shoots by an inch or two.  methodical way has other horticultural advantages, helping to control
attacks from fungal diseases such as black spot, to which roses are
particularly susceptible, by removing infected wood. Before pruning,
use a household disinfectant to clean your pruners, and apply it again
before tackling each new plant to prevent the spread of disease. Also
make sure your pruners are sharp, as clean cuts heal more quickly.sunny and inaccessible banks, since most
require little regular pruning.
Not all roses will thrive in containers,
but smaller patio roses such as R.
ANNA
FORD and R. REGENSBERG are a good choice,
while dwarf trailing or spreading cultivars
are suitable for hanging baskets.

ADZ5–9 H9–5 ROSE CATEGORIES
Grown for the extraordinary beauty of their ﬂowers,
roses have been in cultivation for hundreds of years.
They have been widely hybridized, producing a vast
number of shrubs suitable for growing as specimen
plants, in the border, as hedges, and as climbers
for training on walls, arbors, and pillars. Roses are
classiﬁed into three main groups:
SPECIES
Species, or wild, roses and species hybrids, which
share most of the characteristics of the parent species,
bear ﬂowers generally in one ﬂush in summer and
hips in fall.
Old Garden roses
Alba—large, freely branching roses with clusters
of ﬂowers in mid-summer and abundant, grayish-
green foliage.
Bourbon—open, remontant shrub roses that may be
trained to climb. Flowers are borne, often 3 to a cluster,
in summer–fall.
China—remontant shrubs with ﬂowers borne singly
or in clusters in summer–fall.
Damask—open shrubs bearing loose clusters of usually
very fragrant ﬂowers, mainly in summer.
Gallica—fairly dense shrubs producing richly colored
ﬂowers, often 3 to a cluster, in the summer months.
Hybrid Perpetual—vigorous, remontant shrubs with
ﬂowers borne singly or in 3s in summer–fall.
Moss—often lax shrubs with a furry, mosslike growth
on stems and calyx, and ﬂowers in summer.
Noisette—remontant climbing roses that bear large
clusters of ﬂowers, with a slight spicy fragrance, in
summer–fall.
Portland—upright, rather dense, remontant shrubs
bearing loose clusters of ﬂowers in summer–fall.
Provence (Centifolia)—lax, thorny shrubs bearing
scented ﬂowers in summer.
Sempervirens—semievergreen climbing roses that
bear numerous ﬂowers in late summer.
Tea—remontant shrubs and climbers with elegant,
pointed buds that open to loose ﬂowers with a
spicy fragrance.
Modern Garden roses
Shrub—a diverse group, illustrated here with the Old
Garden roses because of their similar characteristics.
Most are remontant and are larger than bush roses,
with ﬂowers borne singly or in sprays in summer
and/or fall.
Large-ﬂowered bush (Hybrid Tea)—remontant shrubs
with large ﬂowers borne in summer–fall.
Cluster-ﬂowered bush (Floribunda)—remontant
shrubs with usually large sprays of ﬂowers in
summer–fall.
Dwarf clustered-ﬂowered bush (Patio)—neat,
remontant shrubs with sprays of ﬂowers borne
in summer–fall.
Miniature bush—very small, remontant shrubs with
sprays of tiny ﬂowers in summer–fall.
Polyantha—tough, compact, remontant shrubs with
many small ﬂowers in summer–fall.
Groundcover—trailing and spreading roses, some
ﬂowering in summer only, others remontant, ﬂowering
in summer–fall.
Climbing—vigorous climbing roses, diverse in growth
and ﬂower, some ﬂowering in summer only, others
remontant, ﬂowering in summer–fall.
Rambler—vigorous climbing roses with ﬂexible stems
that bear clusters of ﬂowers mostly in summer. Pompon—small, rounded,
double or fully double ﬂowers,
usually borne in clusters, have
masses of small petals.Quartered-rosette—rather ﬂat,
usually double or fully double
ﬂowers have confused petals
of uneven size arranged in a
quartered pattern.Rosette—usually double or
fully double ﬂowers are rather
ﬂat with many confused,
slightly overlapping petals
of uneven size.Rounded—usually double
or fully double ﬂowers have
even-sized, overlapping petals
that form a bowl-shaped or
rounded outline. Urn-shaped—classic, curved,
ﬂat-topped, semidouble
to fully double ﬂowers are
of “Hybrid Tea” type.Pointed—elegant, “Hybrid Tea”
shape; semidouble to fully
double ﬂowers have high,
tight centers.Cupped—open, single to fully
double ﬂowers have petals
curving outward gently from
the center.Flat—open, usually single
or semidouble ﬂowers have
petals that are almost ﬂat. FLOWER SHAPES
With the mass hybridization that has occurred
in recent years, roses have been developed
to produce plants with a wide variety of
characteristics, in particular different forms
of ﬂowers, often with a strong fragrance. These
ﬂower types, illustrated below, give a general
indication of the shape of the ﬂower in its perfect
state (which in some cases may be before it has
opened fully). Growing conditions may affect the
form of the ﬂower. Flowers may be single (4–7
petals), semidouble (8–14 petals), double (15–30
petals), or fully double (over 30 petals).

Roses have beautiful features that create interest for many
months of the year. Although most are grown for their
spectacular ﬂowers, many also produce decorative hips
that provide glowing fall and winter color, offer birds
avaluable source of food, and paint a stunning picture
in frost and snow. Fertilized ﬂowers produce the hips,
so avoid deadheading the blooms, as this will also remove
the fruit. Thorns are another attractive feature on some
species. For example, the winger thorn rose (R. sericea
subsp. omeiensis f. pteracantha) has translucent thorns,
while the ﬁne prickly thorns of moss roses look furry,
adding to their attraction. Prune these roses hard to
ensure a supply of young, thorny wood.

 CLIMBERS AND
WA LL SHRUBS
Versatile and decorative, climbers offer great scope for
imaginative garden design, their scrambling stems veiling other
plants and structures with flowers and foliage. A few, such as
ivy, will also trail across the ground, helping to suppress weeds.
Climbers are often used as a backdrop to other plantings, or
grown over arbors and gazebos to provide shade. You can also
create focal points by weaving them through trees and pyramids
and up pillars, or train them over a trellis to form boundary
screens or dividers between different areas of the garden.
The rigid stems of wall shrubs add another dimension to
vertical schemes, covering walls and fences with
foliage, blooms, and berries.
190One of the most versatile of plant groups, climbers bring height to the garden,
adding interest to walls and fences, and clothing structures such as arches and
arbors with flowers and foliage. A number of shrubs can also be trained against
walls and fences to create textures, patterns, and backdrops to beds and borders.CLIMBERS AND WALL SHRUBS
ABOVE Wisteria-clad wall
Vigorous climbers, such as Wisteria sinensis, need
asturdy trellis or wall for support to display their
heavy flowers to perfection. When grown around
a window, the subtle scent of its flowers can be
appreciated indoors and out./csmall/lsmall/ismall/msmall/bsmall/esmall/rsmall/ssmall /asmall/nsmall/dsmall /wsmall/asmall/lsmall/lsmall /ssmall/hsmall/rsmall/usmall/bsmall/ssmall What are climbers
and wall shrubs?
Most climbers are woody, evergreen
or deciduous plants, while a few are
herbaceous perennials, or summer-
flowering annuals. Climbers can be self-
clinging or twining (with or without
tendrils), or scandent—scrambling species
that do not cling. It is important to identify
the climbing method of your plant, since
this dictates the method of support it needs.
Self-clingers such as Virginia creeper
(Parthenocissus quinquefolia) climb up
their supports using adhesive pads, while
ivies (Hedera) and the Swiss cheese plant
(Monstera deliciosa) use aerial roots to
attach themselves to vertical surfaces.
Self-clinging climbers may initially need
to be guided to their support with canes
(see box below) but will then become
self-supporting. By contrast, twiners coil around the slim stems of a host plant; they
will need wires, mesh, or a trellis to cling
to if they are wall-trained. Clematis, passion
flowers (Passiflora), hops (Humulus lupulus),
sweet peas (Lathyrus), and morning glories
(Ipomoea) fall into this group.
Scrambling plants like winter jasmine
(Jasminum nudiflorum) attach themselves
loosely by threading their flexible stems
through host plants or over a framework
of their old stems made in previous seasons.
On smooth surfaces, such as walls and
fences, their stems must be tied in to wires
or trellis attached to the support, as they
have no other means of clinging.Wall shrubs such as chaenomeles,
pyracanthas, and ceanothus are not natural
climbers, but can be trained to decorate
walls or fences. Some are best grown in
this way, as they require the additional
shelter and support a wall provides.
Ornamental features
Climbing plants have a range of attractive
foliage forms, from the lobed leaves of
Tropaeolum speciosum and palmate foliage
of x Fatshedera lizei, to the heart-shaped
leaves of Actinidia deliciosa. Leaf surfaces
also offer textural contrasts, from the
downy Vitis vinifera to glossy ivies (Hedera).
1 Dig a planting hole
Water the climber before planting. Dig a hole
twice the diameter and deeper than the rootball,
18in (45cm) from the fence. Dig a slightly deeper
hole for clematis, since they need to be planted
4in (10cm) deeper than the top of their rootball.2 Plant the climber
Arrange a fan of canes in the hole. Place the
climber in the hole and slant it toward the canes.
Backﬁll with some soil enriched with rotted organic
matter. Untie the stems from their original support
and spread them out ready to attach to the canes.PLANTING A CLIMBER
Before planting, attach eye screws and horizontal wires, or a trellis, to the wall
or fence. The lowest wire should be about 20in (50cm) above soil level, and the
others 12–18in (30–45cm) apart. Work plenty of organic matter into the soil.
3 Tie in the stems
Using soft garden twine, tie the stems to the
canes using a ﬁgure-eight. Train the lower stems
on to the lower wires and any tall stems at the
center of the plant to cover the high wires. 4 Firm in the soil
Firm in the climber and create a shallow saucer
shape around the base of the plant so that moisture
runs into the area above the roots. Water, and apply
a bark mulch, keeping it away from the plant stems.
 191ABOVE Clematis ‘Bill MacKenzie’
This small-flowered, late-blooming Group 3 clematis
provides a natural, rambling backdrop of nodding
yellow flowers and fluffy seedheads.
/csmall/lsmall/ismall/msmall/bsmall/esmall/rsmall/ssmall /asmall/nsmall/dsmall /wsmall/asmall/lsmall/lsmall /ssmall/hsmall/rsmall/usmall/bsmall/ssmall Colors range from golden-hued Humulus
lupulus ‘Aureus’ to the deep green of many
jasmines, as well as the purple tints of
plants such as Vitis vinifera ‘Purpurea’.
Others have bright, variegated foliage,
such as Actinidia kolomikta, with its green
leaves tipped with splashes of cream and
pink. Some, most notably species of vitis
and parthenocissus, produce their finest
displays in fall, when both fire up with
burning shades of red.
Climbers such as passion flowers
(Passiflora) and clematis bear beautiful
flowers, while some, especially wisteria,
honeysuckles (Lonicera), and jasmines,
are deliciously fragrant. The flower colors
span the spectrum from the creamy
whites of Schizophragma integrifolium
and Hydrangea petiolaris to the magentas
of bougainvillea, blues and purples of a
whole range of clematis, and chocolate-
maroon of Rhodochiton atrosanguineus.
With many climbers, the season is further
prolonged by silky seed heads, as in
clematis, or striking berries, notably
the oblong, purple fruits of Billardiera
longiflora and the orange-yellow fruits
of Celastrus orbiculatus.
Annual climbers such as sweet peas
(Lathyrus odoratus) climb rapidly to the
top of wigwams made from garden canes,
producing a succession of scented flowers
from mid- to late summer that are ideal for
cutting. Morning glory (Ipomoea tricolor
‘Heavenly Blue‘), with its sky-blue trumpets, and black-eyed Susan (Thunbergia alata), also
offer a quick-fix solution, covering a trellis or
adding height to containers on patios.
Wall shrubs are also valued for their
attractive foliage and blooms. Ceanothus,
for example, has both evergreen and
deciduous forms, with flowers in varying
shades of blue, white, and pink. The
flowering quince (Chaenomeles) produces
a profusion of cupped white, pink, orange,
or scarlet-red flowers early in the year,
followed by yellow fruits in the fall. Thorny
pyracanthas make excellent security hedges,
deterring intruders, and sport glossy
evergreen foliage with an abundance of
yellow, orange, or red berries in the fall.
Designing with climbers
and wall shrubs
Growing climbers as a backdrop for other
plants is one way of adding height to a
border, but they can also be grown on
freestanding supports to form screens or
divisions between different parts of the
garden. Grown through trees or on pillars
and pyramids, they also create focal points.
Where a garden lacks shade, climbers
allowed to ramble over arches and arbors
offer a cool place to sit. You can also use
climbers and wall shrubs to soften the
lines of hard landscaping, while vigorous
climbers will help to camouflage unsightly
structures. Left unsupported, some climbers
trail on the ground and, when pegged at the
Pruning Group 2 clematis
Prune this group in early spring when the buds
are in growth and are clearly visible. Work from
the top of the clematis, pruning each stem back
to the ﬁrst pair of healthy buds or shoots. Remove
dead, diseased, or damaged wood; it will be
brown and dry. The pruned stems will produce
new growth and then ﬂowers in early summer. Pruning Group 1 clematis
Plants in this group need little or no pruning
once established, except to remove dead
and damaged stems, or to keep them in
check. After ﬂowering, give them a light trim
if necessary. Prune the leggy new season’s
growth, cutting above a pair of healthy buds,
but do not cut them back hard.Pruning Group 3 clematis
Left unpruned, these clematis form ﬂowers at
the top of the plant, leaving bare, straggly stems
at the bottom. In late winter, before the buds break,
remove the tangle of shoots from their support and
cut back all the stems hard to within 12in (30cm)
of the ground. This encourages strong new shoots
and ﬂowers to form along their length.PRUNING CLEMATIS
Some clematis ﬂower well if pruned lightly or not at all, while others
bloom more eﬀectively when cut back hard. They are divided into three
groups, each with diﬀerent pruning requirements. Group 1 clematis
(including
C. montana  and C. armandii ) are vigorous plants that ﬂower
in late spring on the previous year’s growth. Group 2 clematis, such as C. ‘Corona’, and C. ‘Henryi’, ﬂower in early summer on the previous
year’s growth. Group 3 clematis include small-ﬂowered viticella and
texensis types, such as
C. ‘Gravetye Beauty’, and some large-ﬂowered
types including
C. ‘Perle d’Azur’. They bloom from mid-summer to fall
on new growth formed earlier in the year.nodes, will root to form a carpet of
groundcover. When growing climbers
through other plants, make sure that you
synchronize their flowering times for a
dual effect, and match their pruning needs.
As well as growing shrubs such as
pyracanthas and chaenomeles against
walls, you can train them into fans and
espaliers for a formal effect.

Among the climbers, clematis are unsurpassed in their long
period of ﬂowering (with species ﬂowering in almost every
month of the year), the variety of ﬂower shapes and colors,
and their tolerance of almost any exposure and climate.
Some spring-ﬂowering species and cultivars are vigorous
and excellent for rapidly covering buildings, old trees, and
pergolas. Other, less rampant cultivars display often large,
exquisite blooms from early summer to fall in almost every
color. Flower colors may vary according to your climatic
conditions; generally speaking, the warmer the climate, the
darker the ﬂowers are likely to be.
Clematis look attractive when trained on walls or trellises
and when grown in association with other climbers, trees,
or shrubs, treating them as hosts. Less vigorous cultivars
may also be left unsupported to scramble at ground level,
where their ﬂowers will be clearly visible.
The various types of clematis (see the Plant Dictionary) may
be divided into 3 groups, each of which has different pruning
requirements. Incorrect pruning may result in cutting out
the stems that will produce ﬂowers in the current season,
so the following guidelines should be followed closely.
Group 3
Late, large-ﬂowered cultivars,
Late-ﬂowering species, Small-ﬂowered
cultivars, and Herbaceous types
Flowers are produced on the current
season’s growth only, so prune before
new growth starts, in early spring.
Remove all of the previous season’s stems
down to a pair of strong, leaf-axil buds,
6–12 in (15-30 cm) above the soil.Group 2
Early, large-ﬂowered cultivars
Flowers are produced on short,
current-season stems, so prune
before new growth starts, in early
spring. Remove dead or damaged
stems and cut back all others to
where strong, leaf-axil buds are
visible. (These buds will produce
the ﬁrst crop of ﬂowers.)Group 1
Early-ﬂowering species, Alpina,
Macropetala, and Montana types
Flower stems are produced direct from
the previous season’s ripened stems.
Prune after ﬂowering to allow new
growth to be produced and ripened
forthe next season. Remove dead or
damaged stems and cut back other shoots
that have outgrown their allotted space. Flower stem

Wisterias are large, vigorous, deciduous climbers that
ﬂower in late spring to early summer, producing pendent
racemes 18in (45cm) long or more, of scented, pealike
ﬂowers. These open in shades of white through pale lilac-
blue to dark purple, and are sweetly scented. Often seen
growing on arches and arbors, wisterias need strong
support, as they become heavy with age, and their roots
may damage building foundations. They prefer fertile, moist,
well-drained soil in full sun or partial shade. Unless the soil
is very poor, don’t fertilize them, as this encourages excess
growth. Choosing wisteria can be confusing because many
varieties are commonly mislabeled.

 PERENNIALS
One of the largest plant groups, perennials offer seasonal color,
fragrance, form and texture, with a wealth of plants to suit
every size and style of garden. They are traditionally grown
in herbaceous borders, using a wall or hedge as the backdrop
for the main summer display, but since most gardens are not
large enough for long borders solely devoted to perennials, they
are usually grown in mixed borders, together with shrubs,
annuals, biennials, and bulbs that extend the seasons of interest.
Although some perennials are evergreen, most die back in fall
and emerge again in spring. While this can leave borders bare in
winter, the seedheads and dried stems of some perennials,
including rudbeckias, echinops, and sedums, provide
a beautiful display when others have disappeared.

One of the largest and most versatile plant groups, perennials offer

garden style, from traditional to modern.PERENNIALS

ABOVE Frosted seedheads
Most perennials die down in winter, leaving borders
bare, but a few, such as Echinacea purpurea ‘Kim’s
Knee High’ form decorative seedheads that remain
for many months in winter.
LEFT Contrasting colors and forms
This design focuses on matching the blues and yellows
of delphiniums, echinops, salvias, Thalictrum flavum
subsp. glaucum, nepetas, verbascums, and foxgloves.
Contrasting flower forms intensify the effect.that create a spectacular display in summer.
Today, many people do not have space for
such a scheme, and perennials are now
more commonly used in smaller beds and
borders with other plants, such as shrubs,
bulbs, and annuals. However, the design
ideas employed in these large borders can
be used in more modest schemes, with tall
plants sited at the back, midrange types in
the middle, and compact perennials planted
at the front, ensuring that all can be seen
clearly and no plants are obscured by taller
neighbors. Plants are grouped in swaths of
three or more of the same species, which
lends borders a visual unity and rhythm.
Groups of tall verbascums, eupatoriums,
and delphiniums create a backdrop for the
border plants in front, while low, ground-
covering perennials such as Cerastium
tomentosum and Stachys byzantina are
ideal at the front. Superb effects can then
be created by using large specimens as
a focal points, especially those that have
an architectural form, such as cardoons
(Cynara cardunculus) and bear’s breeches
(Acanthus), or a tall grass such as a
miscanthus or Stipa gigantea.
Introduce variety of shape and texture
by combining the rounded forms of sedums
and geraniums with the upright spires of
Kniphofia or salvias, for instance, or finely-
cut Corydalis flexuosa leaves with the What are perennials?
Perennials are nonwoody plants that live
for two or more years and, when mature,
produce flowers annually. The term often
includes grasses and ferns. Although
some perennials are evergreen, most
are herbaceous and will die back each
fall, emerging again in spring.
Choosing perennials
When making your selections, first check
that the plants suit the climate, exposure,
soil type, and light levels in your garden.
Plants struggling in unsuitable conditions
will not fulfill their intended purpose if
they fail to flower or grow to fill their
allotted space. The best results are usually
achieved by grouping plants with similar cultivation needs; you may also find
inspiration for garden planting schemes by
looking at natural landscapes for symbiotic
planting groups. For example, a deciduous
woodland may feature a range of shade-
loving ferns that marry well together.
When perennials are massed together in
borders, consider their eventual height and
spread to ensure vigorous types do not
overshadow or swamp more delicate plants.

 215/psmall/esmall/rsmall/esmall/nsmall/nsmall/ismall/asmall/lsmall/ssmallDIVIDING PERENNIALS
1 Dig up the plant
In early spring, select a clump of plants and
water them well. Cut back any old top growth to
the ground. Using a fork, lift the clump of plants,
taking great care to keep the whole rootball intact.This easy method of propagation can be used
to propagate most herbaceous perennials as
well as to rejuvenate large, tired clumps that
are no longer ﬂowering well. You can also
divide newly bought perennials, provided
they are large enough and have clearly divisible
stems, to make the most of your purchases.
Most perennials can be divided in fall or early
spring just as the shoots appear.
2 Divide with forks
Cut solid crowns into portions with a spade
or old bread knife. If you cannot pry other pieces
apart by hand, use two forks held back-to-back
to split the clump into smaller sections.
3 Replant the divisions
Discard the dead central portions of overgrown
clumps. Replant healthy, hand-sized pieces with
strong buds in soil improved with well-rotted organic
matter, such as manure. Water in well.Using twiggy sticks
Plants with moundlike growth
will grow through and be
supported by twiggy sticks
placed around stems in spring.Using canes
Bamboo canes are ideal for
supporting tall ﬂowers such as
delphiniums. Use soft twine to
tie the stems to the supports.Using metal spirals
Metal spirals provide good
support for perennials such
as this Pimpinella and also
make decorative features. STAKING BORDER PERENNIALS
Many tall perennials, such as delphiniums and achilleas, become top-heavy and
require some form of support. If you provide plant supports early in the season,
the plants will grow through and disguise them. Plants staked at a later date,
especially once they have already ﬂopped, always tend to look trussed up. ABOVE Contrasting foliage
In damp, dappled shade, elegant contrasts of foliage
form and texture create an atmosphere of lush
abundance. A selection of bergenias, hostas, ferns,
and ligularias are included in this lush scheme.bolder outlines of hostas in shady areas.
Or use the stems of bleeding heart (Dicentra
spectabilis) and Polygonatum x hybridum to
gracefully arch over shorter plants, such as
heucheras and Alchemilla mollis.
When making your selections, consider
the foliage shape, form, and texture as
well as flower colors. The boldly pleated
foliage of veratrums and delicate, pinnate
leaves of Polemonium caeruleum are worthy
of consideration, while furry verbascums
are seductively tactile.
The disadvantage of planting herbaceous
perennials is that the garden looks bare in
winter, unless you plant sturdy types with
long-lasting seedheads, such as sedum, rudbeckias, and many grasses. These can
be left to stand and provide interest until
new shoots appear in spring. Prairie-style
schemes use these types of plants for year-
round interest; rather than planting in long
borders, perennials and grasses are used
in large bold groups, with tall see-through
plants in front of shorter ones. Just a
few plant species are used, and repeated
to mirror nature. The effects of prairie
schemes are best seen in larger gardens.

Few other perennials show such diversity of ﬂower color
as irises; and you will ﬁnd one for almost every position in
the garden. They have a long ﬂowering season, the earliest
appearing in the ﬁrst months of the year, the latest in
early fall. Their ﬂowers often have “beards” (short hairs)
or crests that add to their appeal, while a few are grown
for their foliage or seed heads. The genus is classiﬁed into
many divisions. Of these, the easiest to grow are the bearded,
crested, and Xiphium irises. Siberian and Japanese types
are ideal for bog gardens or watersides, but they will tolerate
drier sites. Juno, Oncocyclus, and Regelia irises are more
difﬁcult to grow, though their beautiful ﬂowers are worth
the effort. For more information, see the Plant Dictionary.

Commonly known as columbines, Aquilegia are ideal
cottage garden plants, well suited to growing in borders,
rock gardens, and as ﬁllers between summer-ﬂowering
shrubs. Most are graceful, elegant plants with divided basal
foliage topped in late spring and summer by a succession
of delicate, bell-shaped, usually spurred ﬂowers, although
some have rounded double blooms. They vary in color
from light and dark blue, purple, almost black, dark red,
and pink, to orange, yellow, and white; many are bicolored.
Aquilegia thrive in moist but well-drained soil, and full
sun or dappled shade. They are normally raised from seed,
which is freely produced, and once established, they tend
to self-seed, although most do not come true to type.

Peonies (Paeonia species and cultivars) are valued for their
showy blooms, ﬁlling borders with whites, pinks, yellows, and
reds in late spring and early to mid-summer. Flowers include
single, double, or anemone forms (with broad, outer petals
and a mass of petaloids in the center); some are scented. They
may need support when in full bloom and make good cut
ﬂowers. The foliage is striking, too, often tinged bronze when
young and rich red in fall. As well as many attractive species
and a wide range of herbaceous hybrids, there are several
tree peonies (cultivars of P. suffruticosa), and intersectional
hybrids, which are crosses between the latter two. Peonies
prefer sun but will tolerate light shade, and need rich, well-
drained soil. These long-lived plants resent transplanting
and are best left undisturbed.

These elegant, colorful, tough perennials are useful
plants for moist sites. Their feathery plumes open
mainly in summer and are composed of hundreds,
sometimes thousands, of tiny ﬂowers that create
diverse forms, from dense and upright to open and
arching. Colors range from white through shades
of pink to deep reds and purples. The blooms are set
against neatly lobed or divided foliage, which, in some
cultivars, has attractive metallic, bronze, or red tints.
All prefer moist soil—they tolerate clay well—in sun
or partial shade, and they make compact clumps in
bog or waterside gardens. Watch out for signs of plant
collapse as astilbes are susceptible to vine weevil attack.

In recent years Persicaria have
increased in popularity, as gardeners
realize the value of these plants in a
range of different situations. Most
ﬂower profusely for many weeks in
summer, while those with handsome
foliage are prized for the beauty of their
leaves rather than their ﬂowers. Taller
selections are usually self-supporting,
while lower-growing types form
weed-suppressing groundcover. Grow
Persicaria in moist soil in sun or partial
shade; P. bistorta tolerates drier soil.
Aword of warning: some, such as
P. ‘Red Dragon’, can be invasive and
need to be kept under control.

Valued for their racemes of foxglovelike ﬂowers,
penstemons are elegant and reliable border perennials.
Numerous cultivars are available, in colors that include
white, pale and dark pink, warm cherry red, clear blue,
and shades of purple. Many ﬂowers have contrasting white
throats or are streaked with other colors. Penstemons ﬂower
proliﬁcally in summer and the display can be prolonged,
provided the plants are regularly deadheaded. Some taller
cultivars may need staking. All types thrive in well-drained
soil, preferably in full sun. Some are not fully hardy, and
where winters are severe, plants should be overwintered in
a cold frame. Plants are more likely to survive frost if grown
in a sheltered spot and mulched in fall. Penstemons are simple
to propagate, and can easily be raised from cuttings.

size from compact plants that grow 12–15in (30–38cm) tall,
to large plants that may reach 5ft (1.5m). They form clumps
of arching, strappy foliage, and ﬂower colors range from
creamy white, yellow, orange, red, pink, and purple, to
almost black; some also have bands of contrasting colors
on the petals. The ﬂower forms are classiﬁed as single,
double, or spider, and some are fragrant. They thrive in
most soils, except waterlogged, in sun or shade, but ﬂower
best when in sun for at least part of the day.

Stalwarts of the summer garden, yarrow (Achillea) are
easy-to-grow perennials for sunny sites and well-drained

herbaceous borders, while shorter forms associate well
with grasses in naturalistic planting schemes. Both selections
also look at home in mixed beds and gravel gardens. Most
have ﬂattened ﬂower heads, creating a horizontal plane
that contrasts well with vertical ﬂower spikes. Available in
a range of colors, including white, yellow, pink, peach, and
red, the ﬂowers change color as they age, creating a two-tone
effect. Many make good cut ﬂowers; some can also be dried.

Of all late-summer, daisy-ﬂowered perennials,
Helenium are among the most colorful. They have
become increasingly popular with the rise of naturalistic
plantings, to which they are well suited, although they
also add a dramatic note to herbaceous borders. The
sturdy stems bear shuttlecock-shaped ﬂowers in ﬁery
tones of red, orange, and yellow that last for many weeks.
Plants seldom need staking and form slowly spreading
clumps if grown in sun and fertile soil. To lengthen the
ﬂowering season, select a variety of forms, and cut back
some in early summer to promote later ﬂowering.

selections associate well with grasses and naturalistic
planting schemes, while the larger ﬂowers are excellent
for cutting. The daisylike, single or double ﬂowers range
in color from white, pink, and red, to purple and blue.
Michaelmas daisies thrive in sun or partial shade and
well-drained soil, and tall cultivars may need staking. For
large ﬂowers, pinch out weaker shoots in spring; to produce
bushier plants with a greater number of smaller ﬂowers,
pinch out the top 1–2in (2.5–5cm) of all shoots in late spring.

S. glutinosa SALVIAS
Hardy perennial salvias are useful
plants, many ﬂowering profusely in
late summer and lasting well into fall.
The genus is quite diverse, with plants
in a range of sizes and ﬂower colors,
including white, true blue, purple, pink,
and red. A few, such as S. argentea, are
also grown for their foliage, which in
many species is aromatic. Salvias thrive
in hot, sunny sites and free-draining
soil, and grow quickly, many developing
into shrublike plants within a season. To
ensure that they survive cold winters, in
fall spread thick mulch over the plants
to protect the roots.

The golden daisy ﬂowers of Rudbeckia illuminate late
summer and early fall borders, perennial schemes, and
gravel gardens. Most are just over knee height, but some
forms of R. hirta are small and compact, ideal for the front of
beds or containers, while others, like R. ‘Herbstonne’, tower
above the rest, reaching up to 8ft (2.5m) in height. R. maxima
also has attractive glaucous blue foliage. All types produce
large ﬂowers on sturdy stems that seldom need staking, and
the blooms also attract beneﬁcial insects. Rudbeckia thrive
in an open, sunny situation, and moist but free-draining soil.

Florist’s chrysanthemums, as well as those that are grown as hardy garden
plants, are grouped according to their differing ﬂower forms, approximate
ﬂowering season (early, mid- or late fall), and habit. The best groups for
garden decoration are the sprays, pompons, and semi-pompons, the hardy
Korean, and early, reﬂexed chrysanthemums. The dwarf Charm-types, forming
dense, domed masses of ﬂowers, are most attractive displayed in pots for both
indoor and outdoor use in fall. Most of the various ﬂower forms are described
below, with further details provided in the Plant Dictionary under Chrysanthemum.
Incurved—fully double,
dense, spherical ﬂowers
have incurved petals
arising from the base
of the ﬂower and closing
tightly over the crown.
Pompon—fully double,
dense, spherical,
or occasionally
hemispherical, ﬂowers,
have tubular petals
with ﬂat, rounded tips,
growing outward
from the crown.Single—ﬂowers each
have about 5 rows of ﬂat
petals, borne at right
angles to the stem, that
may incurve or reﬂex at
the tips; the prominent
central disk is golden
throughout or has a
small, green center.
Fully reﬂexed—fully
double ﬂowers have
curved, pointed petals
reﬂexing outward and
downward from the
crown and back to touch
the stem.
Spoon-type—ﬂowers
are similar to those of
single forms except
that the ray petals are
tubular and open out
at their tips to form
a spoon shape. Reﬂexed—fully double
ﬂowers are similar to
those of fully reﬂexed
forms except that the
petals are less strongly
reﬂexed and form
an umbrella-like or
spiky outline.
Spider-form—double
ﬂower heads with long,
thin ray-ﬂorets; the
outer ray-ﬂorets are
more or less pendent,
the inner ones
curling upward.Intermediate—fully
double, roughly
spherical ﬂowers have
loosely incurving petals,
which may close at the
crown or may reﬂex
for the bottom half of
each ﬂower.
Quill-shaped—double
ﬂower heads with
tubular ray-ﬂorets that
open out at their tips
to form spoon shapes.Anemone-centered—
single ﬂowers each have
a central, dome-shaped
disk, up to half the
diameter of the bloom,
and up to 5 rows of ﬂat,
or occasionally spoon-
type, ray petals at right
angles to the stem.

There are primulas to suit most garden situations, ranging
from boggy areas and pond margins to woodlands, rock
gardens, and containers. Of the various botanical groups,
Candelabra, Auricula, and Primrose-Polyanthus primulas
are the most widely grown. Auriculas are compact evergreen
plants with leathery leaves and ﬂowers with beautiful
markings; they grow well in moist but well-drained soil.
Candelabras prefer damp soil, and are taller and deciduous,
with ﬂowers arranged in rings up sturdy stems. The Primrose-
Polyanthus group includes a diverse range of small winter-
to spring-ﬂowering plants, often sold as bedding or for
containers, that thrive in moist soil. Most prefer some
shade. For full cultivation details, see the Plant Dictionary.

Although perhaps best known for providing excellent,
long-lasting cut ﬂowers, carnations and pinks (Dianthus
cultivars) are highly ornamental border subjects, valued
for their usually fragrant, clove-scented blooms, produced
over a long period in summer, and their distinctive silvery-
or gray-green foliage. Shorter-growing cultivars—the
old-fashioned and modern pinks—make excellent edging
plants. Many of the ﬂowers are attractively marked or have
fringed petals. Carnations and pinks need an open, sunny
position, preferably in alkaline soil. All except the perpetual-
ﬂowering carnations are frost-hardy, and most can be easily
propagated from cuttings. The myriad of carnation and
pinks cultivars are divided into the following groups:
Border carnations—plants are of upright habit and ﬂower
proliﬁcally in mid-summer in a single ﬂush; each stem bears
5 or more ﬂowers. Picotee-ﬂowered forms, with petals
outlined in a darker, contrasting color, are available.

Perpetual-ﬂowering carnations—similar in habit to
border carnations, they are usually grown for cut ﬂowers
and bloom year-round under glass. Plants are normally
disbudded, leaving one ﬂower per stem, but spray forms
have up to 5 ﬂowers per stem.
Malmaison carnations—these produce intensely fragrant
ﬂowers sporadically throughout the year under glass.

Old-fashioned pinks—these have a low, spreading habit
and form neat cushions of foliage; masses of fragrant
ﬂowers are produced in mid-summer. Good for border
edging and cutting.

Modern pinks—usually more vigorous than old-fashioned
pinks, they are repeat-ﬂowering and produce 2 or 3 main
ﬂushes of ﬂowers in summer. Cut or deadhead to encourage
further ﬂowering.
Alpine pinks—in early summer, these plants form cushions
of small, scented ﬂowers. Good for edging, or in a rock
garden, raised bed, trough, or alpine house.

Their luxuriant foliage and attractive habit have made hostas,
or plantain lilies, increasingly sought after as garden plants.
Native to Asia, they add an exotic touch to watersides or
damp, shady corners, and large patio containers. Hostas vary
in size from plants a few inches in height, to tall forms that
make clumps up to 5ft (1.5m) across. Their elegant, deciduous
leaves appear in mid-spring and are incredibly diverse in
shape, texture, and color, with dramatic variegations and
shadings. Many produce decorative ﬂower spikes, which rise
gracefully above the foliage in mid-summer and may be
scented, according to variety. Although hostas are essentially
shade- and moisture-loving plants, preferring rich, well-
drained soil, they also tolerate drier soil. Protect the leaves
from slug damage.

rich blooms also make them a good choice for wildlife and
naturalistic schemes. The ﬂowers of the taller herbaceous plants
are mostly in shades of pink and red, although white and yellow
blooms are also available. Many have purple-tinged or variegated
foliage, which extends their season of interest; the faded ﬂowers
and seed heads also provide a colorful display in late fall and
winter. Plants thrive in full sun and free-draining soil, and will
bulk up quickly. Divide them regularly to prevent clumps from
ﬂopping open, and stake taller varieties. Protect young growth
from slugs in spring and early summer.

Helleborus x hybridus (lenten roses) are
the hybrids between H. orientalis and
other species. They ﬂower in winter and
spring, and are so varied that they’re
often sold by description or collection,
rather than as named varieties. Their
single or double ﬂowers last for a few
months and open in a range of whites,
yellows, pinks, and purples, often
spotted or with darker edges. Most are
evergreen, with large, toothed, divided
leaves, and prefer moist, neutral to
alkaline soil, but need protection from
strong, winter winds. They will naturally
hybridize and self-seed, and it’s worth
allowing your own seedlings to develop.

Once regarded as a useful cottage-garden groundcovering
perennial, grown for its sprays of red ﬂowers and evergreen
foliage, the selections of Heuchera bred in recent years have
transformed this humble plant into a horticultural superstar.
The leaves come in many colors, from near black and purple
to pink, peach, and yellow-green, and plants are ideal for
containers as well as borders. Selections of x Heucherella, a
cross between Heuchera and Tiarella, are smaller and more
dainty. Plant all types in moist but well-drained soil and
partial shade, but site brighter-leaved cultivars in a sunnier
position. Most plants should be split and replanted every
few years to prevent the crown from becoming woody and
to keep them in good health.

 ANNUALS,
BIENNIALS,
AND BEDDING
Invaluable for their rapid growth, instant color, and relatively
low cost, annuals and biennials are ideal gap fillers between
newly planted trees and shrubs, as well as in perennial displays
that might need reviving after the first flush of spring. They are
also useful as bedding in formal designs, such as parterres,
and in containers of all types. An important ingredient
in cottage gardens and wildflower meadows, they also
help to shape informal schemes.

plants flower from early summer to early fall, and some also provide
beautiful foliage. Combine them with plants that bloom in winter and
spring to brighten up your garden all year.ANNUALS, BIENNIALS,
AND BEDDING
BELOW Summer harmonies
Combine the shapes and colors of annuals for a
balanced display. Begonias, heliotropes, silver-leaved
senecio, and zinnias create a vibrant mix.ABOVE Shades of pink
Create an elegant basket using shades of pink. Dark
cherry pink petunias, pale busy Lizzies, starry isotomas,
and raspberry-colored diascias combine beautifully.What are annuals
and biennials?
Annuals are plants that grow, bloom, set
seed, and die in a single growing season.
Biennials complete their life cycle in two
seasons: most are sown in late spring or
summer and produce leafy growth in the
first year, then flower, set seed, and die
in the next. Bedding plants usually refer
to half-hardy or tender annuals that are
traditionally used in summer flower
schemes. Some plants in this category are
technically perennials or even shrubs, but
are referred to as annuals because they are
used for just one season. Examples include
pelargoniums, nemesias, and brachyscome,
which are perennials, and marguerites
(Argyranthemum species) and fuchsias,
which are tender shrubs. Plants in this
group are also sometimes described as
“summer seasonals” and “spring seasonals.”Growing annuals
and biennials
Plants in this category can be grown from
seed, bought as young seedlings known
as “plug” plants, or purchased as mature
specimens ready to plant.
  Sowing seed is the most cost-effective
option if you have a large space or lots of
containers to fill; there are many half-hardy
or frost-tender types that are very easy to
grow in pots or trays on a windowsill or in
a greenhouse, including petunias, French
marigolds (Tagetes), and tobacco plants
(Nicotiana). The seedlings should be
hardened off for a few weeks in spring by
placing them outside during the day and
bringing them back under cover at night.
Then plant them outside in late spring
when all danger of frost has passed.
  Hardy annuals are easier still, as they can
be sown outside in spring where they are
to flower. For earlier summer blooms,
plants like love-in-a-mist (Nigella) and
poppies (Papaver rhoeas) can be sown in
early fall in free-draining soil. Sow your seeds in straight lines or curves, so that you
can distinguish them from weed seedlings
when they germinate.
  For winter and spring color, most suitable
plants, such as violas, are raised from seed
sown in summer. Alternatively, buy young
plants in the fall.
  Biennials can be grown from seed or
bought as plug plants in the summer before
they bloom. Find a quiet corner of the
garden to sow your seeds, as they will
be there for many months, and may be
swamped by other plants if sown directly
into a summer bed or border.
Ornamental features
Annuals and biennials are available in a
wide range of shapes and sizes, from low
hummock-forming cultivars of Ageratum
houstonianum and trailing petunias to the
tall spires of foxgloves (Digitalis purpurea)
and dramatic Scotch thistles (Onopordum
acanthium) that shoot up to 6ft (1.8m).
  Flowers offer a vast choice of colors
and forms, including scented types such
as heliotropes (Heliotropium arborescens),
tobacco plants (Nicotiana species), and the
chocolate-scented Cosmos atrosanguineus.
Colors extend from the opalescent whites
of Lavatera trimestris ‘Mont Blanc’ to the
vibrant scarlets of pelargoniums, bright
orange and yellow California poppies
(Eschscholzia californica), and intense
magentas and purples of petunias.
For more subtle pastel schemes, opt for
plants such as Anoda cristata, blue Silene
 297/asmall/nsmall/nsmall/usmall/asmall/lsmall/ssmall, /bsmall/ismall/esmall/nsmall/nsmall/ismall/asmall/lsmall/ssmall,  /asmall/nsmall/dsmall /bsmall/esmall/dsmall/dsmall/ismall/nsmall/gsmall
Growing summer bedding plants from seed can be very cost-eﬀective,
especially if you have several containers or beds to ﬁll. Sowing seed
in trays indoors is the ideal option for half-hardy or frost-tender plants,
allowing you to start them oﬀ early in spring so that plants are mature  and ready to ﬂower when planted outside. Small seeds, such as petunias,
are diﬃcult to space evenly in trays; seedlings will need to be transplanted
when they have a few leaves to larger trays, pots, or modules. Seed
catalogs oﬀer a huge variety of plants via mail order or online.
2 Sow seeds
Pour some seeds into your hand
and carefully space them out on the
soil surface. Sprinkle sifted seed-
starting mix over the seeds, and cover
to the depth speciﬁed on the seed
packet. Also check the seeds’ required
germination temperature.1 Fill seed trays
Using good-quality seed-starting
mix, ﬁll some clean seed trays to
within 1in (2cm) of the top. Gently
press another seed tray on top to
level out and ﬁrm the surface. Water
the tray with a watering can with a
ﬁne spray and allow to drain.
Pot of seed-sown annuals 3 Cover and keep moist
Label the seed tray, and cover
with a lid or a clear plastic bag. Place
in a light spot. Keep the soil moist,
and remove the lid or plastic bag
as soon as the seedlings emerge.
Harden them oﬀ before planting
them outside.2 Plant up modules
Make a hole in the potting mix
with your ﬁnger or the pencil and
insert a plug into each module
orpot. Firm the soil around the
plants with your ﬁngers, ensuring
that there are no air gaps and
taking care not to compact the
soil or damage the roots. 1 Remove plugs
Water the plugs as soon as
they arrive. Fill large cell trays
or3in (8cm) pots with good-
quality potting mix designed for
seedlings. Use the blunt end of
a pencil to gently push them out
of their original containers from
the bottom.3 Water the plants
Using a watering can with
aﬁne spray, water the plugs
well. Set them in a cool, light,
frost-free place and keep them
well watered. Harden the young
plants oﬀ before planting them
outside after the risk of frost

If you lack the space or time to sow seed, look for seedlings grown in cell packs,
known as “plugs.” Many popular plants, including busy Lizzies, begonias, lobelias, and
fuchsias, are available in this form, with the largest choice available from mail-order
specialists. Pot up small plugs and grow them on indoors until after the last frost.
SOWING SEED IN TRAYScoeli-rosa, baby blue eyes (Nemophila
menziesii), and pale green blooms of
Nicotiana langsdorffii.
To provide a foil for the flowers, consider
the wealth of foliage plants available.
These include the vast variety of coleus
(Solenostemon) with their multicolored
leaves, the bright silver foliage of Senecio
cineraria, and the dark purple-lobed leaves
of Ipomoea batatus ‘Blackie’.
Design options
Annuals and biennials provide an extended
season of color in formal schemes, and are
particularly useful for filling beds and gaps
in borders. In addition, they can be used to
edge flower beds and borders or to create
Victorian-style bedding schemes, which are
enjoying renewed popularity.
Hardy annuals like poppies, cornflowers
(Centaurea), and California bluebell
(Phacelia campanularia) are ideal for
naturalistic or wildlife schemes. For mixed
schemes, grow them in pots like half-hardy
annuals or buy plug plants and set them
between more permanent perennials
and shrubs (many annual seeds will not
germinate in these situations due to
competition from neighboring plants).
Annuals and bedding plants make
striking features in seasonal containers,
windowboxes, and hanging baskets. Use
feature plants, such as fuchsias, zinnias,
and begonias in the center, together with
trailers like Helichrysum petiolatum or
trailing petunias to soften the edges of
your pots. In fall and winter displays, combine dwarf conifers, such as Juniperus
communis ‘Compressa’, with dainty violas.
Year-round color
The long flowering season of annuals and
biennials provides months of color. Violas
flower in winter but put on their best show
in spring, when they are joined by forget-
me-nots (Myosotis) and wallflowers
(Erysimum cheiri), which look particularly beautiful when combined with bulbs such
as daffodils and tulips. Follow these with
any of the summer annuals and biennials,
such as foxgloves (Digitalis). Busy Lizzies
(Impatiens) are particularly useful for shady
sites. Fall stars include Chinese asters
(Callistephus chinensis), and in warm climes,
the fruits of Solanum pseudocapsicum will
brighten a winter day. In cold areas, bring
these bushy evergreens indoors.

Flowering freely all summer and throughout early fall
until the ﬁrst frost, fuchsias make excellent container and
border plants. The single or double blooms vary from small
and dainty to bold and frilly, their colorful outer sepals held
above petals in similar or contrasting hues. A few also boast
variegated foliage. Ranging in habit from strongly upright,
through broad and bushy, to arching and trailing, there are
fuchsias for many garden situations. Upright and bushy
types inject summer color into permanent mixed border
schemes or seasonal bedding displays, while larger types
make good container specimens, combining well with
other summer ﬂowers. Trailing fuchsias are ideal for
hanging baskets and windowboxes.

Pelargoniums are perfect for containers and beds, and ﬂower
almost continuously in warm climates or under glass. Most
fall into one of four main groups. Zonal geraniums have
rounded leaves, clearly marked with a darker “zone,” and
single to double ﬂowers. Regal types are shrubby with
serrated leaves and delicate, trumpet-shaped ﬂowers. Ivy-
leaved pelargoniums are trailing plants with lobed leaves and
single to double ﬂowers—a good choice for hanging baskets.
Scented-leaved types and species have small, star-shaped
ﬂowers and are grown principally for their fragrant foliage.
Unique types are tall subshrubs with regal, brightly colored
ﬂowers; some also have scented leaves. To ﬂower well, all
types need sun and well-drained soil.

The genus Begonia is one of the most versatile, providing
interest throughout the year. Semperﬂorens begonias are
excellent for summer bedding, while the Rex-cultorum
group offers distinctive, handsome foliage in a huge variety
of decorative shades and unusual textures. Other begonias,
such as the Tuberhybrida cultivars with their large, showy
blooms, are grown mostly for their ﬂowers. Most begonias
are not suitable for permanent outdoor cultivation in
frost-prone areas as they are not hardy, but they make
attractive houseplants and displays in summer containers.
Begonias may be ﬁbrous-rooted, rhizomatous, or tuberous,
the tubers becoming dormant in winter. Grow them in
a light position, shaded from direct sun.

 ROCK PLANTS
Rock plants are prized for their natural charm, foliage forms,
and, in many cases, masses of colorful flowers in spring and
summer. Grow them in areas that mimic the conditions in which
they thrive in the wild, which are usually exposed sites with
stony, rapidly draining soils. As long as they have sharp
drainage and protection from excessive winter moisture, you
can grow rock plants in small gardens in a trough or container,
or where there is more space, in a rock garden or scree bed. If
the soil in your garden is unsuitable, you can also grow these
ground-hugging plants in raised beds to create landscapes in
miniature. Raised beds also have the advantage of bringing
the small plants closer to eye level so that you can admire
their tiny, delicate features in more detail.
330
The delicate flowers and foliage of many rock plants belies their tough
nature, withstanding the burning sun and harsh winds typical of their
alpine habitats. They make excellent plants for the garden, and are
perfect for rock and scree gardens, wall crevices, troughs, and pots. ROCK PLANTS
ABOVE Mediterranean mountains
Recreate a Mediterranean alpine scene with clay
pots and pebbles decorating beds that include a
range of sedums, saxifrages, thymes, and arabis,
with clipped boxwood balls providing structure.
LEFT Colorful tapestry
Siting a rock garden on a gentle slope assists rapid
drainage, while an open, sunny site is perfect for alpines.
Choose plants with contrasting forms, such as teardrop-
shaped, upright conifers and mats of colorful blooms./rsmall/osmall/csmall/ksmall /psmall/lsmall/asmall/nsmall/tsmall/ssmallThese adaptations help them survive the
drying, high-velocity winds, brilliant,
burning sun, and extreme temperature
fluctuations of their natural habitats.
Most rock plants grow in areas that
have stony soil with rapid drainage,
which explains why few can cope with wet
soil around the roots, which is experienced
at lower altitudes. They also dislike warm,
humid summers.
In the wild, high-growing species are
insulated from winter cold by a blanket of
snow, beneath which they remain dormant
at temperatures around 32°F (0°C) until
spring. Those environments that mimic
conditions in the wild, such as rock
gardens, scree and gravel beds, troughs,
pots, raised beds, and open frames, are
therefore ideal for growing rock plants. You
can grow alpines successfully even in areas
where the soil is unsuitable by filling raised
beds, pots, and troughs with free-draining
soil and horticultural grit.Designing with  rock plants
One of the major attractions of this
group is their diminutive size, which
allows you to grow a huge number of
different plant types in a relatively
confined space.
In a rock garden—as in larger-scale
plantings—use small shrubs, such as
the highly fragrant Daphne cneorum
and D. retusa or the catkin-bearing Salix
bockii and S. apoda, to form the structural
framework of your design. Miniature
conifers, such as Juniperus communis
‘Compressa’, provide vertical accents
and year-round color, and work well in
combination with the contrasting forms
of rounded or domed plants, such as the
evergreen Hebe cupressoides ‘Boughton
Dome’ and Cassiope lycopodioides.
This structure can then be filled in with
mat- and cushion-forming plants, such as
sandworts (Arenaria) or Dianthus deltoides, What are rock plants?
The term rock plants includes bulbs and
mat- and cushion-forming perennials—
many of which are evergreen—as well as
dwarf conifers and both evergreen and
deciduous shrubs. Some are true alpines
from mountain regions, while others are
simply compact plants suitable for rock-
garden planting schemes. While some
alpines have specialized needs, many
species and cultivars, including aubrietas
and geraniums, are easy to grow and thrive
in any well-drained soil and sunny site.
True alpines are found at high altitudes
above the tree line on mountains, growing
on scree slopes, in short sod, or finding
protection from the wind by squeezing
into rock crevices. Subalpine plants live
below the tree line on rocky slopes or in
high pastures or meadows. Most alpines
are compact in habit and frequently deep-
rooting, usually with small leaves that
are leathery, fleshy, or covered in fine hair. Large Medium Small

suppressing fabric over the soil ﬁrst. This eliminates light and stops weed
seeds from germinating but still allows moisture through to the plant.Gravel gardens are ideal for alpines and rock plants. Stones can be worked
into a scheme to create a rock garden, or a variety of rock and stone sizes
used on a slope to form a natural scree. A gravel or slate chip mulch helps
1 Prepare the trough
Cover the drainage holes at the base of the
trough with crocks. Add a 2in (5cm) layer of gravel.
Fill up the trough with equal parts of soil-based
potting mix and sand, to 2in (5cm) from the top.
2  Add slates and plants
Push the slate chips vertically into the medium,
leaving spaces for the alpines. Water the plants, and
plant them into the gaps, making sure the roots are
covered with the sand and soil mix. Water well.PLANTING A SLATE-FILLED TROUGH
Topped with slate chips, this decorative trough
mirrors a natural mountain scree, and provides
a long season of color in spring and summer.
Plants included in this display are
Draba
species, erigerons, saxifrages, Silene acaulis
and
Townsendia grandiﬂora. However, any
small alpines that have diﬀerent leaf textures
and ﬂower colors will work equally well. Move
your trough to its ﬁnal position before you start,
as it will be very heavy once planted.at the feet of slightly taller, feathery-leaved
pulsatillas or the airy Linum narbonense.
As well as shape and form, think about
contrasting textures. Candidates include
the almost beadlike foliage of certain
sedums, spiky houseleek (Sempervivum)
rosettes, and the pointy-tipped gray leaves
of Euphorbia myrsinites, which would make
eye-catching partners for the white-haired
leaves of edelweiss (Leontopodium) or the
silky, silver leaves of celmisias.
Most alpines like an open sunny site
and will not thrive if they are shaded by
overhanging trees or neighboring plants.
Plant them with space to spread, and use
a dry mulch, such as gravel, to keep the
stems and leaves dry at all times. Mulches
also act as a foil for the plants.
If you have limited space, plant a
selection of alpines in small pots filled with
gritty potting mix. Many plants in this
group are drought-tolerant and thrive in
containers, and when grouped together
make colorful displays. Troughs can be
given a modern makeover by planting
alpines between slate chips (see box right),
or using a ground glass or shell mulch.
Raised beds offer another design option
for those with small gardens. They are also
useful for people with reduced mobility,
allowing them to access the plants more
easily. Use raised beds to create miniature
landscapes with plants spreading between
rocks and pebbles. Dry-stone walls offer
ideal sites for many crevice-lovers, such
as aubretias and sedums, while cascading
alpines, such as Saxifraga ‘Tumbling
Waters’, are perfect for the tops of walls.Year-round interest
Many alpines flower in spring and early
summer, just after the snow melts and
before the heat of mid-summer in their
natural habitat. For color earlier in the
year, plant spring bulbs, such as alpine
narcissus or crocuses, among evergreen
perennials, conifers, and small shrubs.
The choice of flowers at the peak flowering
times is vast, so coordinate your color schemes for a dramatic performance.
Hot colors, such as the bright yellow
sedums and wallflowers (Erysimum) and
scarlet and orange helianthemums, create
highlights against more subdued blues and
purples. As the summer progresses, select
later-flowering rock plants, including phlox,
crepis, and diascias, followed by the pink
Silene schafta, gentians, and berry-bearing
gaultherias in the fall.

Although there are gentians large enough to hold their own
in the herbaceous border, most are low-growing, deciduous or
evergreen perennials, best suited to rock gardens, where they
can form spreading mats. Flowering between spring and fall,
they are renowned for their vivid blue trumpet-shaped ﬂowers,
which are produced in pale shades, such as G. ‘Strathmore’, to
intensely dark, such as G. acaulis, although there are also white-
and yellow-ﬂowered forms. All require a cool position, sheltered
from hot summer sun. Most need light, rich, moist but well-
drained neutral soil; fall-ﬂowering species and cultivars, such
as G.sino-ornata, require acidic conditions to thrive. Protect
from slugs and snails, particularly in spring.

The main attraction of houseleeks (Sempervivum) is their
colorful rosettes of leaves. These range from bright yellow,
through various shades of green, gray, pink, purple, red,
and orange, to almost black. The leaves may be dull or glossy,
or covered with soft down or longer hairs. Leaf shape can
also vary from short and succulent to long and tapering. The
rosettes are most striking in the spring and summer, but even
in the winter, many varieties remain attractively colored. It is
the endless range of different leaf shapes, shades, and textures
that make this group so interesting to enthusiasts. They do not
like damp or shady conditions, but thrive in well-drained soil
in full sun. Houseleeks are ideal for pots or sink gardens on
a south-facing patio, or can be planted out in rock gardens
or in the crevices of stone walls.

 BULBS
Bulbous plants are found throughout the world in habitats as
diverse as woodland and scrub, meadows, river banks, the edges
of streams, and rocky hills and mountains. There are bulbs to suit
every garden site and design, from the tiny Iris danfordiae for a
rock garden, to daffodils and tulips in beds and borders, and the
carpeting erythroniums or statuesque Cardiocrinum giganteum
for a woodland garden. Most have a distinct flowering season, yet
with careful planning it is possible to extend or enhance this
period of interest. Although most bloom in spring or early
summer, producing splashes of color before many shrubs
and perennials reach their peak, plant snowdrops for
late winter color, and colchicums, cyclamen, and some
crocuses to brighten a fall day.

/bsmall/usmall/lsmall/bsmall/ssmallEmbracing a wide range of decorative plants, bulbs provide exciting
effects throughout the year, with large drifts of snowdrops in late winter,
daffodils and tulips in spring, the exquisite perfume of lilies and vibrant
dahlia colors in summer, and the spidery flowers of nerines in fall.  BULBS
BELOW Carpets of spring color
A selection of daffodils has been naturalized in the
grass beneath silver birches and spring-flowering
trees, creating a sea of nodding yellow flowers.What are bulbs?
The term “bulb” can be used to describe all
swollen, underground, food-storage organs,
and includes true bulbs as well as corms,
rhizomes, and tubers. True bulbs have fleshy
scales—modified leaves or leaf bases—that
overlap and are often enclosed in a papery
tunic, as in narcissi, or they may be naked
and loosely arranged like lily bulbs.
Corms are compressed and enlarged
stem bases, usually enclosed in a fibrous or
papery tunic, as in the crocus. Each corm
lasts one year, and is replaced by a new one
after flowering. Tubers, such as cyclamen,
are solid, underground sections of modified
stem or root and seldom possess scales or
tunics. Rhizomes are modified stems that
creep at or just below soil level, and may be
thin and wiry or swollen and fleshy.
A few bulbs are evergreen, but most
grow and bloom during a short season,
and then die back to below ground level.
Their leaves produce the food store for  the following year, which is why the foliage
must not be cut down after flowering but
allowed to wither naturally.
When below ground, bulbs are described
as dormant, but they are, in fact, ripening
and developing the following year’s flowers,
and must be planted in a suitable site to
thrive. Bulbs that originate from dry, hot
climates, such as nerines and watsonias,
need warm, dry conditions when dormant
to aid ripening and flower formation,
while those from woodlands or other
damp, shaded habitats, such as bluebells
(Hyacinthoides) and snowdrops (Galanthus),
require a cool, slightly moist spot.
Designing with bulbs
There are bulbs to suit all garden designs
and planting styles. They range in size from
the tiny Iris danfordiae and fall daffodil
(Sternbergia lutea), both suitable for a scree
or rock garden, to carpeting erythroniums
for the dappled shade of a woodland
garden, midrange alliums and tulips for a
hot, sunny border, and tall, slender regal
lilies that produce highly scented flowers
on stems up to 6ft (1.8m) in height. The Bulbs are divided into smaller plant
categories, including true bulbs, corms,
and tubers. All of these swollen,
underground, food-storage organs help
the bulb to survive periods of drought. BULB DEFINITIONS
Bulb
A true bulb is a storage organ made up of
stems and ﬂeshy leaves inside. Examples
include daﬀodils, tulips, and eucomis (above).
Corm
Swollen stems that have adapted to store
food are known as corms. They appear solid
throughout, and include crocuses (above).
Tuber
Tuberous plants have swollen underground
roots or stems. Examples include cyclamen,
dahlias (above), and begonias.Large Medium Small

(75cm) (23–75cm) (23cm)SIZE CATEGORIES USED WITHIN THIS GROUP
 381/bsmall/usmall/lsmall/bsmall/ssmallflower forms also lend themselves to certain
garden styles. Tulips with sculptural
cupped flowers planted en masse, and the
sharp flower shapes of many dahlias, are
ideal for formal schemes, while the looser
flower forms of nectaroscordums and
turkscap lilies, and arching spikes of
crocosmias create an informal look. Sod
spangled with crocuses or snake’s-head
fritillaries (Fritillaria meleagris) mimics
their wild habitat and provides early
color in naturalistic schemes.
Bulbs add seasonal color and interest
to mixed borders with annuals, shrubs, and
perennials. Daffodils (Narcissus), crown
imperials (Fritillaria imperialis), alliums,
and dahlias all blend well with other types
of plantings. Unscented lilies make good
partners for scented roses, while exotic-
looking cannas and alstroemerias add spice
to a tropical design. If you can't squeeze
bulbs into your border, many are perfectly
at home in containers and baskets.
Year-round interest
Choose carefully, and you can have a bulb
in flower for most of the year. The first to
appear in late winter are the snowdrops
(Galanthus) and winter aconites (Eranthis),
while early narcissus, muscari, crocuses,
scillas, chionodoxas, dwarf iris, and
Anemone blanda mark the onset of spring.
In mid-spring, fill your garden with
vibrant yellow daffodils and bright tulips,
or opt for the same plants in pastel shades—
the choice is vast for both genera. Summer-flowering bulbs, such as Galtonia
candicans, most alliums, the Peruvian
daffodil (Hymenocallis narcissiflora), and
ornithogalums offer colorful highlights.
These are followed in late summer by
gladioli, crinums, dahlias, and crocosmias,
which may continue to bloom into the fall
until the first frost. When the summer

need to plan ahead to create the most spectacular displays. In fall, look for
bulbs at garden centers or in mail-order catalogs, and check ﬂowering times
for a synchronized display of tulips, daﬀodils, and grape hyacinths (Muscari).
2 Cover the bulbs
Now place the next layer
of bulbs, such as tulips, between
the daﬀodil bulbs, and cover with
more potting mix. Finally, add
small bulbs, like grape hyacinths,
on this top layer, and cover with
potting mix. Press down lightly
with your hands, and leave the
pot in a sheltered sunny spot.1 Plant in layers
In fall, place crocks at the
bottom of a large pot and add
a 2in (5cm) layer of gravel.
Then add a layer of good-quality
potting mix. Place the largest
bulbs—for example, daﬀodils—
on the surface and cover with
more potting mix so that the
tips are just visible.
A multicolored displayLAYERING BULBS IN CONTAINERS
spectacle is over, select fall-flowering
nerines, crocuses, colchicums, and
cyclamen, and to end the year, use
Cyclamen hederifolium, whose marbled
foliage often persists into winter.
For scented bulbs, choose hyacinths,
bluebells, and scented daffodils for spring,
and lilies and crinums for summer displays.
NATURALIZING BULBS
You can create spectacular eﬀects by
naturalizing bulbs in a lawn or under trees.
Choose robust plants, such as snowdrops,
daﬀodils, and crocuses, which are able
to compete with tree roots and grass. To
achieve a natural, random eﬀect, toss the
bulbs in the air and plant them individually
where they fall. For each bulb, dig out a
small plug of sod and soil, two to three
times the depth of the bulb. After ﬂowering,
when the leaves have died, mow the grass.

Commonly known as the Peruvian lily, lily of the Incas,
or parrot lily, these South American tuberous perennials
are prized for their delicate funnel-shaped blooms in
yellow, orange, pink, red, white, or purple, with decorative
markings in contrasting colors. They also have an
exceptionally long ﬂowering season, from mid-summer
to the ﬁrst frost, and make excellent cut ﬂowers. Most
suppliers offer plants, rather than tubers, which are best
planted in spring after the last frost in a sunny site and
free-draining soil, giving the roots time to establish
before winter. Young plants are vulnerable to cold, wet
conditions—protect them in winter with a thick mulch
of well-rotted compost or manure.

Lilies (Lilium species and cultivars) make elegant additions
to summer borders and containers. Their ﬂamboyant ﬂowers
range from nodding, upright, and trumpet-shaped forms, to
turkscaps with recurved petals. The blooms are often spotted
with a darker or contrasting color, or have conspicuous
stamens. Many lilies have a powerful, sweet fragrance, most
notably the Oriental and Longiﬂorum hybrids, although a
few species are unpleasantly scented. The hybrids thrive
in sun and well-drained soil, and are available in a dazzling
array of colors, from white, pink, and red, to shades of
yellow and orange. Lily species prefer partially-shaded sites;
some also require acidic soil. Leave plants undisturbed once
established, as the bulbs are easily damaged. For more
information, see the Plant Dictionary.

Grown as much for their dramatic foliage as for their
ﬂamboyant ﬂowers, cannas are ideal for lush tropical
planting schemes, as an accent plant in a border, or as
a bold addition to container displays. Large paddle- or
broadly lance-shaped leaves are produced in a range of
colors, from green to dark maroon, and many are striped
or variegated, while the vibrant red, orange, or yellow
ﬂowers bloom for many months from summer to early fall.
Plant these tender South American rhizomatic perennials
after the last frost in spring in fertile soil and full sun—they
require heat to ﬂower well. In fall, cut down the stems and
leaves when frost blackens the foliage, and store the
rhizomes in a frost-free place over winter.

The wide spectrum of dahlia hybrids offers a bold display of color and form
from summer to the ﬁrst frosts of fall. Flower colors range from deep red,
crimson, purple, mauve, and vibrant pink, to white, apricot, orange, bronze,
and bright scarlet, while the blooms range from tiny 2-in (5-cm) pompons to
huge exhibition blooms more than 10in (25cm) across.
Dahlias ﬂower proliﬁcally—in the right conditions, a single plant may produce
up to 100 blooms. They make beautiful border plants, compact types are ideal
for containers, and all are good for cutting. In addition, no special skills are
required to grow them, but protect the tubers from frost. The ﬂower types
below indicate the recognized groups.
Single—ﬂowers usually
have 8–10 broad petals
surrounding an open,
central disk.
Anemone—fully double
ﬂowers each with one or
more rings of ﬂattened
ray petals surrounding
a dense group of shorter,
tubular petals, usually
longer than petals of
single dahlias.
Collarette—single
ﬂowers with 8–10 broad,
outer petals, and an inner
“collar” of smaller petals
surrounding an open,
central disk.
Water-lily—fully double
ﬂowers with large,
generally sparse ray
petals, which are ﬂat or
with slightly incurved
or recurved margins,
giving the ﬂower a
ﬂat appearance.
Decorative—fully double
ﬂowers with no visible
central disk, and broad,
ﬂat petals, sometimes
twisted, that incurve
slightly at their margins.Ball—spherical, fully
double ﬂowers, sometimes
slightly ﬂattened on top,
with densely packed,
almost tubular, petals.
Pompon—a miniature
form of ball ﬂowers, but
more spherical in shape,
with fully double ﬂowers
no more than 2in (5cm)
in diameter.
Cactus—fully double
ﬂowers have narrow,
pointed petals that can be
straight or curl inward
and have recurved edges
for more than two-thirds
of their length.
Semi-cactus—fully
double ﬂowers similar
to cactus types, but with
broader-based petals,
the edges of which are
generally recurved
toward their tips.
Miscellaneous—ﬂowers
that fall into a wide range
of unclassiﬁed types,
including peony-like
(shown right), single,
and double forms.

Tulips are excellent in the rock garden, in formal bedding,
as elegant cut ﬂowers, and for containers. Their bold ﬂowers
are generally simple in outline and held upright, often with
bright, strong colors. Many of the species deserve to be
more widely grown alongside the large variety of hybrids
currently available. Tulipa is classiﬁed in 15 divisions, which
are described below.
Div. 1 Single early—cup-shaped, single ﬂowers, often opening
wide in sun, are borne from early to mid-spring.
Div. 2 Double early—long-lasting, double ﬂowers open wide in
early and mid-spring.
Div. 3 Triumph—sturdy stems bear rather conical, single ﬂowers,
becoming more rounded, in mid- and late spring.
Div. 4 Darwin hybrids—large, single ﬂowers are borne on strong
stems from mid- to late spring.
Div. 5 Single late—single ﬂowers, usually with pointed petals,
are borne in late spring and very early summer.
Div. 6 Lily-ﬂowered—strong stems bear narrow-waisted, single
ﬂowers, with long, pointed, often reﬂexed petals, in late spring.
Div. 7 Fringed—ﬂowers are similar to those in Div. 6, but have
fringed petals.
Div. 8 Viridiﬂora—variable, single ﬂowers, with partly greenish
petals, are borne in late spring.
Div. 9 Rembrandt—ﬂowers are similar to those in Div. 6, but have
striped or feathered patterns caused by viruses, and appear in late spring.
Div. 10 Parrot—has large, variable, single ﬂowers, with frilled or fringed
and usually twisted petals, in late spring.
Div. 11 Double late (peony-ﬂowered—usually bowl-shaped, double
ﬂowers appear in late spring.
Div. 12 Kaufmanniana hybrids—single ﬂowers are usually bicolored,
open ﬂat in sun and appear in early spring; leaves often mottled or striped.
Div. 13 Fosteriana hybrids—large, single ﬂowers open wide in the
sun from early to mid-spring. Leaves are often mottled or striped.

Narcissus species and hybrids grace the garden from early to late spring
with diverse ﬂowers, ranging from the tiny Cyclamineus types, with their
swept-back petals, to the stately trumpet daffodils. Some are also scented,
including the Poeticus, Jonquilla, and many of the small-ﬂowered forms.
Daffodils can be naturalized to form a carpet in grass or a wild garden,
or used to brighten up beds and borders, but dwarf forms are best in
rock or gravel gardens, or planted in pots and troughs.
The genus is classiﬁed in 13 divisions. Their ﬂower forms are illustrated
below, with the exception of Div. 12, miscellaneous, and Div. 13, which
comprise mostly wild species. Both have varying ﬂowers, including hoop-
petticoat forms, and are produced between fall and early summer.
Div. 1 Trumpet—usually
solitary ﬂowers, each with
a trumpet that is as long
as, or longer than, the
petals. Early to late
spring-ﬂowering.
Div. 2 Large-cupped—
solitary ﬂowers, each
with a cup at least one-
third the length of, but
shorter than, the petals.
Spring-ﬂowering.
Div. 3 Small-cupped—
ﬂowers are often borne
singly, each with a cup
not more than one-third
the length of the petals.
Spring- or early
summer-ﬂowering. Div. 7 Jonquilla and
Apodanthus—sweetly
scented ﬂowers, usually
1–5 per stem. Cups are
short, sometimes ﬂanged;
petals are often ﬂat, fairly
broad, and rounded. Mid-
to late spring-ﬂowering.
Div. 8 Tazetta—clusters
of 12 or more small, fragrant
ﬂowers per stem, or 3 or 4
large ones. Cups are small
and often straight-sided;
petals are broad and mostly
pointed. Late autumn- to
mid-spring-ﬂowering.
Div. 4 Double—most
have solitary large, fully or
semi-double ﬂowers with
the cup and petals, or just
the cup, replaced by petaloid
structures. Some have
smaller ﬂowers in clusters
of 4 or more. Spring- or
early summer-ﬂowering.
Div. 11 Split-cupped—
usually solitary ﬂowers
with cups split along more
than half their length.
Spring-ﬂowering.
(a) Collar—wide cup
segments lie back on
the petals.
(b) Papillon—narrower
cup segments have tips
arranged at the margin
of the petals.Div. 5 Triandrus—
2–6 nodding ﬂowers per
stem, each with a short,
sometimes straight-sided
cup and narrow, reﬂexed
petals. Spring-ﬂowering.
Div. 6 Cyclamineus—
usually 1 or 2 ﬂowers per
stem with cups that are
sometimes ﬂanged and often
longer than those of Div.5.
Petals are narrow, pointed,
and reﬂexed. Early to
mid-spring ﬂowering.Div. 9 Poeticus—1–2
ﬂowers per stem, each
with a small, colored cup
and glistening white petals.
Most are sweetly scented.
Late spring- or early
summer-ﬂowering.
Div. 10 Bulbocodium—
ﬂowers usually borne
singly on very short
stems, with insigniﬁcant
petals and large, widely
ﬂaring cups. Winter- to
spring-ﬂowering.

Cormous perennials with ﬂowers in vibrant shades
of yellow, orange, and red, and sword-shaped, pleated
foliage, crocosmias are real crowd-pleasers. The ﬂowers
are held on elegant arching stems and bloom for many
weeks between mid-summer and fall. Most are easy to
grow, spreading quickly when conditions are right for
them. Plants, rather than corms, are the best choice for
beginners, and should be planted in spring in moist but
well-drained fertile soil in sun or partial shade. Those
that are borderline hardy will beneﬁt from a warm site
near a protective wall.

Crocus species and cultivars are versatile dwarf bulbous
plants. Most ﬂower in late winter or early spring; a few
bloom in fall. Colors range from white, cream, and yellow to
pinkish-lilac and purple, and many are attractively striped or
feathered with other colors. The goblet-shaped ﬂowers open
wide in full sun, in some cases revealing contrasting centers
or conspicuous stamens. Most crocuses are also fragrant.
Plant in rock or gravel gardens with other early ﬂowering
dwarf bulbs or perennials, in drifts in grass, or beneath
deciduous trees and shrubs, where they will rapidly spread.
If naturalized in grass, delay mowing until the leaves have
died down. Feed with an all-purpose granular fertilizer once
the ﬂowers have faded.

 WATER AND
BOG PLANTS
The sound and reflective qualities of water have long been used
to animate garden designs, and whether tiny or large, formal or
informal, every garden has space for a water feature. A pond,
pool, or container also greatly extends the range of plants that
you can grow. They are classified according to the depth of water
required for them to thrive, and include deep-water aquatics,
marginal plants, and moisture-lovers or bog plants. Together,
they offer a succession of interest, providing a diversity of
foliage, form, and flower color. Informal ponds with sloping
sides and richly planted banks will also attract a wide range

designs. It also greatly extends the range of plants that you can grow,
with aquatic and moisture-loving types injecting color, texture, and
form into water features. They also provide excellent wildlife habitat. WATER AND BOG PLANTS

Tiny but perfectly formed, this patio water feature,
fringed by ferns, supports flowering irises and arum
lilies. Flow from a pump helps to oxygenate the water.What are water plants?
The broad definition of water plants
includes all plants that grow rooted,
submerged, or floating in water. They
are further subdivided into deep-water
aquatics, surface- or free-floating plants,
marginals, and bog or moisture-loving
plants, depending on the depth of water
they require.
Water plants are grown for their beauty
and ornamental value, but when a wide
range of plants are grown together, they
also create a healthy ecosystem that
maintains the quality of the water in a
feature or pond. A balanced range of plants
will regulate the levels of light, oxygen, and
nutrients, helping to keep the water clear.
Submerged plants like hornwort
(Ceratophyllum demersum) are known
as “oxygenators.” These purify the water
by using up nutrients and excluding light,
which prevents algal growth. Surface-
floaters, such as water hyacinths (Eichhornia
crassipes), also absorb dissolved nutrients.
Deep-water plants, including water lilies
(Nymphaea), root at the bottom of ponds,
while their flowers and leaves shade the
surface, again helping to prevent the growth
of algae. The roots of marginal plants are
submerged, but their top growth is visible
above the water, providing shelter for fish,
amphibians, and other wildlife.
Ornamental planting
To maximize the planting potential of
your pond, create areas at varying depths
to accommodate different types. Begin
planting at the center of your pond, using
deep-water plants, such as Cape pondweed
(Aponogeton distachyos) with its white
flowers that pop up at the surface, and the
floating water soldier (Stratiotes aloides),
which has spiky leaves; both require a
depth of about 24–36in (60–90cm). (See  box below for details on plant depths.)
Most water lilies need to root at depths
of 12–36in (30–100cm), depending on the
species or cultivar. Dwarf water lilies, such
as Nymphaea tetragona or slender water
irises (Iris laevigata) are good choices for
water aquatics on bricks and lower them to their ﬁnal depth as they grow.
Fill the pool a few days before planting to allow the water to reach the air
temperature and become populated with beneﬁcial microorganisms.PLANTING DEPTHS
A pond with a range of planting depths allows you to grow a wide range
of plants. Place plants at their appropriate depths, measured from the
top of the soil in their containers to the water surface. Support young deep
Bog plants are

 433/wsmall/asmall/tsmall/esmall/rsmall /asmall/nsmall/dsmall /bsmall/osmall/gsmall /psmall/lsmall/asmall/nsmall/tsmall/ssmallABOVE Marginal planting
The curving edges of an informal pool offer ideal
conditions for marginals such as Pontederia cordata
and Sagittaria latifolia. Marginals disguise plastic
liners and provide shelter for wildlife.a small pond or water feature. Marginal
plants thrive in shallow water. Many are
planted just below the surface, while water
irises prefer a depth of about 6in (15cm)
and pickerel weeds (Pontederia) like their
roots submerged to a depth of 12in (30cm).
Marginals help to disguise liners at the
edges of ponds, create reflections, and
provide wildlife cover. They have a range
of habits, from the bog bean (Menyanthes
trifoliata) with its clusters of white flowers
in spring, to the flowering rush (Butomus
umbellatus) with its umbels of small pink
flowers, and the large, calla-like blooms
of skunk cabbages (Lysichiton). Larger
areas can be enhanced by bold clumps
of cattails (Typha latifolia), while
architectural plants such as Pontederia
cordata provide focal points with their
leaves and flower spikes.
The damp areas around the edges of
a pond provide ideal conditions for bog
natives and moisture-lovers. In very wet
bogs, marginals will survive, but in drier
conditions, opt for moisture-lovers. Bog
gardens must have either drainage or water
flowing through them to provide oxygen
for the plant roots.
Designing with
water plants
Every garden has space for a water feature
and its associated plants, but match your
plants to the size and design of your pond.
Informal pools have sloping sides and
boggy banks to attract birds, amphibians,
and small mammals that prey on garden
pests. In winter, water that is more than
24in (60cm) deep will help creatures
survive freezing temperatures. The great
specimens that are free of algae and pond weeds. All submerged plants,
such as water lilies and oxygenators, can be planted in the same way. Lift
them from the pond for dividing and repotting every two or three years.
1Use a pond basket
Choose a pond basket with small
holes to prevent soil from leaking out
into the water. Place a layer of aquatic
potting mix in the bottom. 2Position the plant
Remove the plant from its pot and
put it in the center of the basket at the
same level. Fill around the plant with
more potting mix, ﬁrming as you go.3Mulch with gravel
Clean any algae or duckweed
from the plant’s leaves and stems.
Wash some pea gravel and apply a
thin layer to stabilize the soil surface.
Established water lily pondPLANTING A POND
Submerged plants are planted in baskets rather than pots, using aquatic
potting mix. Garden soil is unsuitable because it often contains nutrients
that encourage the growth of algae. When choosing plants, look for healthy advantage of an informal pool is that it offers
versatility: its sinuous margins are longer than
straight-sided ponds of a similar size, and the
sloping banks provide a range of planting
depths, increasing your choice of plants.
In small gardens, avoid vigorously
spreading plants, such as the flag iris
(Iris pseudacorus) or Glyceria maxima.
For architectural plants for bogs, try
Filipendula camtschatica and Miscanthus
sacchariflorus. Astilbes, trollius, primulas,
and ferns provide color around the edges.
Seasonal care
In fall, cut away dead foliage, trim over-
sized plants, and remove weeds. It is also
a good idea to place a net over ponds close
to deciduous trees, as the fallen leaves can foul the water. Aim to reach a balance, so
that rotting vegetation releases enough
nutrition for next year’s growth, but not
so much as to encourage algae.
Water plants are best divided and
repotted in spring as they start into growth.
Keep planting baskets weeded, removing
annual weed seedlings as they appear, as
well as surplus water-plant seedlings. This
task can be eased by deadheading the
plants after flowering. Small ponds and
water features will also need topping off
in summer, using rainwater if possible.

and include miniature types that spread up to 24in (60cm)
in diameter and need a water depth of just 8in (20cm);
medium lilies, ranging from 3 to 5ft (1–1.5m); and large
types that extend 5–12ft (1.5–4m) or more—these require
a water depth of 24in (60cm) or more. All water lilies

 TENDER AND
EXOTIC PLANTS
Tropical and subtropical regions are home to a huge range
of plants, each thriving in varying growing conditions. If you live
in these areas, you can grow tender plants outside and create
dramatic planting schemes with architectural forms and exotic
flowers. In temperate regions, grow these exotic plants either
under glass or indoors as houseplants. There is a wealth of form,
color, and texture available, from plants with handsome foliage
to those with beautiful blooms, including bougainvilleas and
peace lilies. Unlike those grown outside, indoor plants are not
subject to seasonal extremes, and many need relatively little
attention, apart from watering, fertilizing, and annual repotting.
448Gardeners have long been fascinated by tender and exotic plants that
bring color and interest from all corners of the world. In warmer regions
many of these can be grown in the garden, but in cooler areas they’re
best treated as houseplants, at least for part of the year.TENDER AND EXOTIC PLANTS
What are tender and
exotic plants?
This group of plants originate from many
parts of the world, including tropical and
subtropical areas, where they require
temperatures no lower than 34–64°F
(1–18°C), even in winter. Their specific
cultural demands vary between plants and
can be complex. In addition to warmth,
many also require high light levels, long
growing seasons, and often either very
arid or humid growing conditions. A small
few, including cacti and succulents, can
tolerate frost if kept dry, but most cannot.
  Where the climate allows, tender and
exotic plants can be grown in the garden;
where it doesn't, they must be grown
indoors. The most tender plants require
permanent protection and are commonly
grown as houseplants, including flamingoflower, Anthurium andraeanum, peace lily,
Spathiphyllum wallisii, and Madagascar
jasmine, Stephanotis floribunda. Other
plants are more robust and can spend
the summer in sheltered positions in the
garden, being brought back in before the
first frost. These include Banksia coccinea,
the Australian heath, Epracris impressa,
and king protea, Protea cynaroides.
Designing with
tender plants
The range of tender and exotic plants is
vast, and includes many with bold flowers,
attractive foliage, or an architectural habit.
With such a diverse variety to grow, they
are ideal for many different situations and
planting styles. In areas where they can be
grown outdoors all year, they can form the mainstay of beds and borders, even entire
gardens, from jungle schemes to desert-
style borders. In cooler areas, where they
can only spend the warm summer months
outside, they can still play a prominent role.
Pot-grown plants like Agave americana,
Ensete ventricosum, and even the bird of
paradise, Strelitzia reginae, for example, will
all give a dramatic but temporary display in
the garden, or on a deck or roof terrace.
Indoors, tender and exotic plants can be
put to many uses, from statement plants
in grand reception rooms, and year-round
greenery in conservatory planters, to lone
windowsill potted plants for seasonal color.
ABOVE Exotic flowers for indoors
Frangipani (Plumeria rubra) is famed for its rich scent
and must be grown permanently in a large heated
conservatory, where it can become very large. It needs
a minimum winter temperature of 50°F (10°C).BELOW Dramatic foliage
The Japanese sago palm (Cycas revoluta) is one of
many tender shrubs that can be enjoyed indoors
during winter, but can be put outside for summer.
It is grown for its sculptural foliage and habit. /tsmall/esmall/nsmall/dsmall/esmall/rsmall /asmall/nsmall/dsmall  /esmall/xsmall/osmall/tsmall/ismall/csmall /psmall/lsmall/asmall/nsmall/tsmall/ssmall
ABOVE Conservatory climber
Bougainvillea is a vigorous shrubby climber in warmer
climates. It needs a minimum temperature of 45°F
(7°C), and must be treated as a large conservatory
plant in cooler areas.
 449LEFT In a natural setting
In their native hot, dry climates, cacti and other
succulents can achieve spectacular dimensions. Even
in cooler temperate gardens they can still make a bold
impression, but they must be brought in for the winter
and repositioned outside again each summer.
1Make a base
Fill the base of a large, plastic-
lined container with clay pebbles
to hold the orchids in place, and to
provide drainage and humidity. In a
permanent community planter, you
should use a suitable planting mix. 2Position the plants
Place the orchids into the container,
making sure the top of their pots sit just
below the rim. Make sure the plants are
upright and facing the right direction,
before adding more pebbles to hold
the plants in place.3Dress the top
Add a layer of moss or decorative
material around the orchids to disguise
the pots underneath. This will also
help maintain humidity, although if
you use natural moss, it will need to
be sprayed regularly to keep it healthy.
The completed planterMAKING AN ORCHID PLANTER
Orchids, such as Colmanara Masai gx ‘Red’, all require particular conditions
to perform at their best. Where you have a suitable spot indoors, take full
advantage of it and position two or more plants in the same container, at least while they‘re in ﬂower. This will serve as a temporary community-
planter, which will beneﬁt the plants, and also create a more attractive
display than growing them as individual specimens. /tsmall/esmall/nsmall/dsmall/esmall/rsmall /asmall/nsmall/dsmall  /esmall/xsmall/osmall/tsmall/ismall/csmall /psmall/lsmall/asmall/nsmall/tsmall/ssmallWhen choosing and positioning tender
plants indoors, consider the conditions they
require. Light levels may be poor, even near
windows, and air-conditioning and central
heating can create a dry atmosphere, which
many plants dislike. Another consideration
is how large the plants will become;
many exotic plants commonly grown as
houseplants, such as Swiss-cheese plant,
Monstera deliciosa, and Bougainvillea,
occupy considerable space over time,
although they can be pruned and trained.Caring for tender plants
Tender and exotic plants, like any other
garden plant, all have their preferred
growing conditions, so consider your site,
soil, and exposure carefully when planting
outdoors. This is even more important
when growing them indoors as the plants
are reliant on you for their care. The best
approach is to try to mirror their natural
conditions as closely as possible, providing
the same degree of heat, light, shade,
humidity, and ventilation. It is also very important to observe their natural growing
seasons by fertilizing and watering them
more frequently when they're in growth,
less so, if at all, when they are dormant.
Heated conservatories and greenhouses
provide the best indoor habitat for most
tender plants, although many also thrive in
houses. The care they require depends on
the plant, but as a guide, position sun-loving
plants near the windows, shade-lovers
farther away, and maintain high humidity
levels by standing your plants on trays of
moist gravel and misting them regularly.
Some plants, such as moth orchids,
Phalaenopsis, require good light but not
direct sunlight. This can be achieved by
positioning them by a north-facing window,
or on a shelf close to a bright window. Also
watch out for pests, which can flourish in
the favorable conditions you provide.
Finding areas that provide optimal
growing conditions for houseplants
indoors can be difficult, so it is worth
making best use of them where they occur.
A good approach is to plant “community
planters” and grow plants that enjoy
similar conditions together in a single
container. This is ideal for sun-loving cacti,
as well as epiphytic orchids and bromeliads
that need high humidity, and insectivorous
plants that prefer very moist soil.

Elegant and exotic, orchids are prized for their unusual
ﬂowers. There are two main groups. Terrestrials [t] grow
in a wide range of habitats in the wild; many are at least
frost hardy. Epiphytes [e], the more showy of the two
and mostly native to the tropics, cling to tree branches
or rocks, obtaining nourishment through their leaves and
aerial roots. An aura of mystique surrounds these plants,
but their cultivation is not always difﬁcult and some
thrive indoors as houseplants. They need special growing
medium and in cool climates must be grown under glass.
An orchid hybrid is called a grex [gx], from the Latin for a
ﬂock. A grex name applies to all the individual seedlings
from any given cross, the individual plants of which may also
be given cultivar names. Several cultivars may also be given
a Group name within a grex. See also the Plant Dictionary.

Bromeliads, or plants that belong to the family Bromeliaceae,
are distinguished by their bold, usually rosetted foliage
and showy ﬂowers in shades of white, red, or purple, borne
in dense, cylindrical or conical inﬂorescences in summer.
The ﬂowers are followed by ovoid yellow fruits containing
large brown seeds. Many bromeliads are epiphytes, or
air plants (absorbing their food through moisture in the
atmosphere), and will grow outdoors only in tropical
regions. In cooler climates, bromeliads make attractive
houseplants or will thrive in a warm greenhouse. Follow
watering instructions with care.

cultivars derived from S. ionantha. These low-growing,
rosetted, evergreen perennials have a wide range of
attractive ﬂower colors, varying from white, pink, blue,
and violet, to bi- or multicolored. Their petal edges can
berufﬂed, rounded, frilled, or fringed, and leaves are
somewhat succulent, usually hairy, and, in some cases,
variegated. They may be grown as summer bedding
inwarm, humid climates but also make attractive
houseplants, ﬂowering freely throughout the year if
kept in a suitable draft-free, light, humid location.

Gingers have been cultivated in Europe for over 100 years
and bring colorful, intricate ﬂowers, tropical foliage, and,
quite literally, spice to the garden. Evergreen types need
tobe overwintered under glass or gradually dried off in
fall to induce artiﬁcial dormancy, whereas many deciduous
types such as Roscoea and Cautleya will die off naturally
and, being frost-hardy, can remain in the ground with
a protective mulch. Most gingers do not tolerate wet
winter conditions and beneﬁt from some shade. A brighter
location encourages ﬂowering, whereas shade encourages
better foliage, so site accordingly. They should not be
allowed to dry out while in growth, and are heavy feeders,
so give them frequent applications of liquid fertilizer.

Tough plants originating from the Americas, agaves
are able to withstand drought, heat, and full sun. Some
species are frost-hardy too. Agaves arrest attention
with bold rosettes of thick sculptured leaves, often of
great architectural value. The rosette slowly increases in
size over several years before producing a ﬂower spike,
sometimes of treelike proportions, so site carefully. Some
species die after ﬂowering, but may produce seed, bulbils
among the ﬂowers, and offsets around the base of the old
rosette. Care should be taken when planting due to sharp
thorns at the end of the leaves.

Aloes are abundant in Mediterranean and African
gardens. There is a huge range of species and hybrids
providing a kaleidoscope of growth forms, ﬂowers,
and leaf variegation. Unlike agaves, aloes do not die
after ﬂowering, but gradually produce a trunk, becoming
shrubs or small trees. Aloes typically produce their
leaves singly, and the center of the rosette is usually
hollow, reminiscent of a bromeliad. A few species, such
as A. aristata, are frost-hardy, and can be grown in rock
gardens or at the base of a south-facing wall in mild areas.

are divided into the following groupings,
each with varying cultivation requirements.
See also feature panel p.317.
Cane-stemmed begonias
Evergreen, woody perennials, many known
as “Angelwings,” with usually erect, canelike
stems bearing regularly spaced,
swollen nodes and flowers in large,
pendulous panicles. Encourage branching
by pinching out growing tips. New growth
develops from base of plant. Grow under
glass in good light but not direct sun (poor
light reduces quantity of flowers) and in
free-draining, soil-based potting mix. Stake
tall plants. Propagate in spring by seed or
tip cuttings.
Rex-cultorum begonias
Mostly evergreen, rhizomatous perennials
of variable habit derived from crosses of
begonia rex and related species. They are grown
for their brilliantly colored, oval to lanceshaped
leaves, 3–12in (8–30cm) long, that
are sometimes spirally twisted. Prefer
40–75% relative humidity. Grow under
glass in cool climates, in partial shade
and well-drained soil; water only sparingly.
Do not allow water to remain on the leaves,
otherwise they become susceptible to
botrytis. Propagate in spring by seed,
leaf cuttings or division of rhizomes.
Rhizomatous begonias
Variable, mostly evergreen, rhizomatous
perennials, grown for their foliage and
small, single flowers. Smooth, crested or
puckered, green or brown leaves, 3–12in
(8–30cm) long, often marked silver, are
sometimes spirally twisted. Creeping
cultivars are more freely branched than
erect ones and are useful for hanging
baskets. Prefer 40–75% relative humidity.
Grow under glass in cool climates, in
partial shade and well-drained soil; water
only sparingly. Do not allow water to
remain on the leaves, otherwise they
become susceptible to botrytis. Propagate
in spring by seed, leaf cuttings or division
of rhizomes.
Semperflorens begonias
Evergreen, bushy perennials, derived from
begonia cucullata var. hookeri, begonia schmidtiana and
other species, often grown as half-hardy
bedding annuals. Stems are soft, succulent
and branch freely, bearing generally
rounded, green, bronze or variegated
leaves, 2in (5cm) long. Flowers are single
or double. Pinch out growing tips to
produce bushy plants. Needs sun or partial
shade and well-drained soil. Propagate in
spring by seed or stem cuttings.
Shrublike begonias
Evergreen, multistemmed, bushy
perennials, usually freely branched with
flexible, erect or pendent stems, often hairy.
Leaves may be hairy or glabrous and up to
6in (15cm) across, 4–12in (10–30cm) long.
Single flowers are pink, cream or white.
Prefer 55% relative humidity. Grow under
BEGONIA
glass in good light and moist but welldrained
soil. Propagate in spring by seed
or stem cuttings.
Tuberous begonias (including the
Tuberhybrida, Multiflora and Pendula
begonias)
Mostly upright, bushy, tuberous, winterdormant
perennials grown for their foliage
and flowers. Tuberhybrida begonias, H and
S 30in (75cm), vary from pendent to erect,
with sparsely branched, succulent stems
and oval, pointed, glossy, bright to dark
green leaves, 8in (20cm) long. Most are
summer flowering and mainly doubleflowered.
Multiflora cultivars, H and S 12in
(30cm), are more bushy and have 3in (8cm)
long leaves and single, semidouble or
double flowers, each 11/2–2in (4–5cm)
across, in summer; tolerates full sun.
Pendula cultivars, H to 3ft (1m), have long,
thin, trailing stems; leaves are 21/2–3in
(6–8cm) long. Masses of single or double
flowers are borne in summer. Outdoors,
grow in dappled shade and moist
conditions; under glass, plant in cool shade
with 65–70% relative humidity. Tubers are
dormant in winter. Start into growth in
spring for mid-summer to early fall
flowering. Remove all flower buds until
stems show at least 3 pairs of leaves; with
large-flowered types allow only central
male bud to flower, so remove flanking
buds. Plants may require staking.
Propagate in spring by seed, stem or
basal cuttings or division of tubers.
Winter-flowering begonias
Evergreen, low-growing, very compact
perennials, with succulent, thin stems,
that are often included in the tuberous
group. Two main groups are recognized:
the single-flowered, usually pink or white,
Lorraine, Cheimantha or Christmas
begonias; and the single, semidouble
or double, Elatior and Rieger begonias,
which occur in a wide range of colors.
Leaves are green or bronze, 2in (5cm) long.
Flowers are borne mainly from late fall to
mid-spring. Prefer 40% relative humidity.

CHRYSANTHEMUM
COMPOSITAE/ASTERACEAE
Genus of annuals, perennials, some of
which are evergreen, and evergreen
subshrubs, grown for their flowers. Each
flower head is referred to horticulturally as
a flower, even though it does in fact
comprise a large number of individual
flowers or florets; this horticultural usage
has been followed in the descriptions
below. Leaves are usually deeply lobed or
cut, often feathery, oval to lance-shaped.
Florists’ chrysanthemums (nowadays
considered to belong to the genus
Dendranthema) comprise the vast majority
of chrysanthemums now cultivated and are
perennials grown for garden decoration,
cutting and exhibition. Florists’
chrysanthemums (and the other
chrysanthemums treated here) generally
perform well in Z5–9 H9–5; for extra
protection, crowns should be lifted and
stored in a frost-free place over winter.
Needs a sunny site and reasonably fertile,
well-drained soil. If grown for exhibition,
requires regular feeding. Pinch out
growing tips to encourage lateral growths
CHRYSANTHEMUM
on which flowers will be borne, and stake
tall plants with canes. Propagate annuals
by seed sown in position in spring; thin
out, but do not transplant. Propagate hardy
perennials by division in fall, after
flowering, or in early spring. Florists’
chrysanthemums should be propagated
from basal softwood cuttings in spring.
Spray regularly to control aphids, capsids,
froghoppers, earwigs, mildew and white
rust.
Florists’ chrysanthemums
Florists’ chrysanthemums are grouped
according to their widely varying flower
forms, approximate flowering season
(early, mid- or late fall) and habit. They are
divided into disbudded and non-disbudded
types. For descriptions and illustrations of
flower forms, see feature panel pp.252–3.
Disbudded types—single, anemonecentered,
incurved, intermediate and
reflexed—are so called because all buds,
except the one that is to flower, are
removed from each stem. To produce
exhibition flowers, incurved, intermediate
and reflexed chrysanthemums may be
restricted to only 2 blooms per plant by
removing all except the 2 most vigorous
lateral growths. In gardens, allow 4 or 5
blooms per plant to develop. Single and
anemone-centered flowers should be
reduced to 4–8 blooms per plant for
exhibition, according to their vigor, and 10
or more for garden decoration or cutting.
Non-disbudded types—charm, pompom
and spray chrysanthemums—have several
flowers per stem.
Charm chrysanthemums are dwarf plants
that produce hundreds of star-shaped,
single flowers, 1in (2.5cm) across, densely
covering each plant to form a
hemispherical to almost spherical head.
For exhibition, finish growing in at least
12in (30cm) pots. Plants for indoor
decoration are grown in smaller pots and
have correspondingly smaller, though
equally dense, heads of blooms.
Pompom chrysanthemums are also dwarf.
Each plant has 50 or more dense, spherical
or occasionally hemispherical, fully double
flowers that have tubular petals (for
illustrations see p.252). They are excellent
for growing in borders.
Semi-pompom chrysanthemums,
sometimes called Japanese pompom, have
similar flowers to those of the pompom but
as they mature the yellow centers are
revealed.
Spray chrysanthemums have a variety of
flower forms: single, anemone-centered,
intermediate, reflexed, pompom, spoonshaped
(in which each straight, tubular
floret opens out like a spoon at its tip),
quill-shaped and spider-form. Each plant
should be allowed to develop 4 or 5 stems
with at least 5 flowers per stem. Grow l
ate-flowering sprays on up to 3 stems
per plant. With controlled day length, to
regulate flowering dates for exhibition
purposes, late sprays should be allowed
to develop at least 12 flowers per stem;
without day length control, 6 or 7 flowers
per stem.
Korean Group chrysanthemums
Korean Group chrysanthemums have a
variety of flower forms: anemone-centered,
pompom, reflexed, single, intermediate,
spider, quill and spoon. All are derived
from plants originally developed in
Connecticut in the 1930s and the prime
quality, which they all have in common, is
their dependable hardiness: they can be left
in the ground all winter without protection.
They are ideal for general garden use, in
fact they require little special treatment
other than good winter drainage; their
hardiness can be compromised if grown in
poorly drained soil. Some are usefully late
in coming into flower; some need support
while others are short and bushy. The taller
types make good cut flowers.
Those most suitable for garden decoration
are sprays, pompoms and early reflexed
chrysanthemums. All are suitable for
cutting, except for charms. Late-flowering
chrysanthemums are suitable for growing
only under glass as flowers need protection
from poor weather; they should be grown
in pots and placed in a greenhouse in early
fall, when the flower buds have developed.
Intermediate cultivars are also less suitable
for garden decoration as florets may collect
and retain rain and thus become damaged.
Those cultivars suitable for exhibition are
noted below. Measurements of flowers
given are the greatest normally achieved
and may vary considerably depending on
growing conditions.

CLEMATIS
RANUNCULACEAE
Genus of evergreen or deciduous, mainly
twining climbers and herbaceous
perennials, cultivated for their mass of
flowers, often followed by decorative seed
heads, and grown on walls and trellises
and together with trees, shrubs and other
host plants. Only early-flowering species
are evergreen, although some laterflowering
species are semievergreen. Most
species have nodding, bell-shaped flowers,
with 4 petals (botanically known as
perianth segments), or flattish flowers,
each usually with 4–6 generally pointed
petals. Large-flowered cultivars also bear
flattish flowers, but with 4–10 petals.
Flower color may vary according to
climatic conditions: in general, the warmer
the climate, the darker the flower color.
May be grown in partial shade or full sun,
but prefers rich, well-drained soil with
roots shaded. Propagate cultivars in early
summer by softwood or semiripe cuttings
or layering, species from seed in fall.
Aphids, mildew and clematis wilt may
cause problems.
Clematis may be divided into groups
according to their flowering seasons, habit
and pruning needs. See also feature panel
pp.198–200.

(4–5cm) across, are borne on the previous
season’s ripened shoots in spring or,
occasionally, in late winter. Leaves are
evergreen and glossy, or deciduous, and
usually divided into 3 lance-shaped,
5in (12cm) long leaflets or into 3 fernlike,
2in (5cm) long leaflets.
clematis alpina, clematis macropetala and their
cultivars tolerate cold, exposed positions.
Small, bell-shaped to open bell-shaped,
single, semidouble or double flowers,
2in (5cm) across, are borne on the previous
season’s ripened shoots in spring,
occasionally also on the current season’s
shoots in summer. Deciduous, pale to
mid-green leaves are divided into 3–5
lance-shaped to broadly oblong, toothed
leaflets, 11/4in (3cm) long.
clematis montana and its cultivars are
vigorous, deciduous climbers, suitable for
growing over large buildings and trees.
Small, flat to saucer-shaped, usually single
flowers, 2–3in (5–7cm) across, are borne on
the previous season’s ripened shoots in late
spring. Leaves are mid- to purplish-green
and divided into 3 lance-shaped to broadly
oval, serrated leaflets, 3in (8cm) long with
pointed tips.
Prune all group 1 clematis after flowering
to allow new growth to be produced and
ripened for the following season. Remove
dead or damaged stems and cut back other
shoots that have outgrown their allotted
space. This will encourage new growth to
bear flowers in the following season.
Group 2
Early- to mid-season, large-flowered
cultivars bearing mostly saucer-shaped,
single, semidouble or fully double flowers,
4–8in (10–20cm) across, that are borne on
the previous season’s ripened shoots, in
late spring and early summer, and on new
shoots in mid- and late summer. Generally
the second flush of flowers on semidouble
and double forms produces single flowers.
Deciduous, pale to mid-green leaves are
usually 4–6in (10–15cm) long and divided
into 3 ovate or lance-shaped leaflets, or are
simple and ovate, and to 4in (10cm) long.
Prune before new growth starts, in early
spring. Remove any dead or damaged
stems and cut back all remaining shoots
to where strong buds are visible. These
buds provide a framework of second-year
shoots which, in turn, produce sideshoots
that flower in late spring and early summer.
The flowers may then be removed. Young
shoots bear more flowers later in the
summer.
Group 3
Late, large-flowered cultivars
producing outward-facing, usually saucershaped,
single flowers, 3–6in (7–15cm)
across, borne on new shoots in summer or
early fall. Leaves are deciduous and similar
to those of early cultivars (group 2),
described above.
Late-flowering species and smallflowered
cultivars that bear small, single
or double flowers on the current season’s
shoots in summer–fall. Flowers vary in
shape and may be star-shaped, tubular,
bell-shaped, flattish or resembling nodding
lanterns; they vary in size from 1/2in (1cm)
to 4in (10cm) across. Have generally
deciduous, pale to dark green or graygreen
leaves divided into 3 lance-shaped to
broadly oval leaflets, each 1/2in (1cm) long,
or hairy and/or toothed leaves divided into
5 or more lance-shaped to broadly oval
leaflets, each 1/2–4in (1–10cm) long.
Herbaceous species and cultivars
producing single flowers that are either
saucer-shaped, 1/2–3/4in (1–2cm) wide, or
bell-shaped or tubular, 1/2–11/2in (1–4cm)
long, and are produced on the current
season’s shoots in summer. Mid- to dark
green or gray-green leaves are simple and
lance-shaped to elliptic, 1–6in (2.5–15cm)
long, or are divided into 3–5 lance-shaped
to ovate, serrated leaflets, each 4–6in
(10–15cm) long with a pointed tip. Prune
all group 3 clematis before new growth
begins, in early spring. Cut back all the
previous season’s stems to a pair of strong
buds, 6–8in (15–20cm) above soil level.

CONIFERS
Group of trees and shrubs, distinguished
botanically from others by producing seeds
exposed or uncovered on the scales of
fruits. Most conifers are evergreen, have
needlelike leaves and bear woody fruits
(cones). All genera in the Cupressaceae
family, however, have needlelike juvenile
leaves and, excepting many junipers and
some other selected forms, scalelike adult
leaves. Conifers described in this book are
evergreen unless otherwise stated.
Conifers are excellent garden plants.
Most provide year-round foliage, which
may be green, blue, gray, bronze, gold or
silver. They range in height from trees 130ft
(40m) or more tall to dwarf shrubs that
grow less than 2in (5cm) every 10 years.
Tall conifers may be planted as specimen
trees or to provide shelter, screening or
hedging. Dwarf conifers make good
features in their own right as well as in
groups; they also associate well with
heathers, add variety to rock gardens and
provide excellent groundcover. They may
also be grown in containers.
Position and soil
Cupressus, x Cuprocyparis, Larix and
Pinus need full sun. Cedrus, Juniperus
and Pseudolarix do not tolerate shade. All
other conifers will thrive in sun or shade,
and most Abies and all Cephalotaxus,
Podocarpus, Taxus, Thuja, Torreya and
Tsuga will grow in deep shade once
established. Wollemia prefers a sheltered
location out of full sun.
Conifers grow well on most soils, but
certain genera and species will not do well
on soils over chalk or limestone. In this
book, such conifers are: Abies, Pseudolarix,
Pseudotsuga and Tsuga; also Picea, except
P. likiangensis, P. omorika and P. pungens;
and Pinus, except P. aristata, P. armandii,
P. cembroides, P. halepensis, P. heldreichii,
P. nigra, P. peuce and P. wallichiana.
Certain conifers tolerate extreme
conditions. Abies alba, azorina homolepis,
azorina nordmanniana, Cryptomeria,
Cunninghamia, Metasequoia, Pinus coulteri,
P. peuce, P. ponderosa, Sciadopitys,
Sequoia, Sequoiadendron and Taxodium
will grow on heavy clay soils. Picea
omorika, P. sitchensis, Pinus contorta,
Sciadopitys verticillata and Thuja plicata are
all happy on wet soil, and Metasequoia and
Taxodium thrive in waterlogged conditions.
Cupressus, Juniperus and Pinus grow well
on dry, sandy soil.
Pruning
If a conifer produces more than one leader,
remove all but one. Bear in mind when
trimming hedges that most conifers will not
make new growth when cut back into old
wood or from branches that have turned
brown. This does not, however, apply to
Cephalotaxus, Cryptomeria, Cunninghamia,
Sequoia, Taxus, Torreya and Wollemia, and
these conifers may be kept to a reasonable
size in the garden by cutting back the main
stem, which will later coppice (make new
growth). Young specimens of Araucaria,
Ginkgo, Metasequoia and Taxodium will
sometimes do the same.
COREOPSIS
Propagation
Seed is the easiest method of
propagation, but forms selected for leaf
color (other than blue in some species)
do not come true. Sow in fall or spring.
All genera apart from Abies, Cedrus,
Picea (except young plants or dwarf
forms), Pinus, Pseudolarix, Pseudotsuga
and Tsuga (except young plants or dwarf
forms) may be raised fairly easily from
cuttings: current growth from fall to
spring for evergreens, softwood cuttings
in summer for deciduous conifers. Tallgrowing
forms of Pinaceae (Abies,
Cedrus, Picea, Pinus, Pseudolarix,
Pseudotsuga and Tsuga) are usually

Pests and diseases
Honey fungus attacks many conifers,
especially young plants. Most resistant to
the disease are Abies, Calocedrus, Larix,
Pseudotsuga and Taxus. Green spruce
aphid may be a problem on Picea, and
conifer spinning mite may defoliate Abies,
Picea and some Pinus.

DAHLIA
COMPOSITAE/ASTERACEAE
Genus of bushy, summer- and fall-flowering,
tuberous perennials, grown as bedding
plants or for their flower heads, which are
good for cutting or exhibition. Dwarf forms
are used for mass-planting and are also
suitable for containers. Needs a sunny
position and well-drained soil. All apart
from dwarf forms require staking. After
flowering, lift tubers and store in a frost-free
place; replant once all frost danger has
passed. In frost-free areas, plants may be left
in ground as normal herbaceous perennials,
but they benefit from regular propagation to
maintain vigor. Propagate dwarf forms
by seed sown under glass in late winter,
others in spring by seed, basal shoot
cuttings or division of tubers. Dahlias may
be subject to attack by aphids, red spider
mite and thrips. In recent years, powdery
mildew has become a problem in certain
areas, and spraying is essential. Dahlias also
succumb quickly to virus infection. See also
feature panel pp.396–98.
Border dahlias
Prolific and long-flowering, various species
of Dahlia have been hybridized and, with
constant breeding and selection, have
developed into many forms and have a
wide color range (although there is no
blue). Shoots may be stopped, or pinched
out, to promote vigorous growth and
a bushy shape. Spread measurements
depend on the amount of stopping carried
out and the time at which it is done: early
stopping encourages a broader shape,
stopping later in the growing season
results in a taller plant with much less
spread, even in the same cultivar. Leaves
are generally mid-green and divided into
oval leaflets, some with rounded tips and
some with toothed margins. Each flower
head is referred to horticulturally as a
flower, even though it does in fact comprise
a large number of individual flowers. This
horticultural usage has been followed in
the descriptions below. All forms with
flower heads to 6in (15cm) across are
suitable for cutting; those suitable for
exhibition are so noted.
Groups and flower sizes
Dahlias are divided into groups, according
to the size and type of their flower heads,
although the latter may vary in color
and shape depending on soil and weather
conditions. The groups are: (1) single;
(2) anemone; (3) collerette; (4) water-lily;
(5) decorative; (6) ball; (7) pompon; (8) cactus;
(9) semi-cactus; (10) miscellaneous;
(11) fimbriated; (12) single orchid; (13) double
orchid. For illustrations and descriptions
see p.396. Certain groups have been
subdivided; flower sizes are as follows:
Groups 4, 5, 8 and 9
A—giant-flowered; usually over 10in
(25cm) in diameter. B—large-flowered;
usually 8–10in (20–25cm) in diameter.

DIANTHUS
CARYOPHYLLACEAE
Genus of evergreen or semievergreen,
mainly summer-flowering perennials,
annuals and biennials, grown for their
mass of flowers, often scented, some of
which are excellent for cutting. Carnations
and pinks (see below) are excellent for cut
flowers and border decoration, the biennial
dianthus barbatus is suitable for bedding and
smaller, tuft-forming species and cultivars
are good for rock gardens. Needs an open,
sunny position and well-drained, slightly
alkaline soil, except for dianthus pavonius, which
prefers acid soil. Dead-heading of repeatflowering
types is beneficial. Tall forms of
carnations and pinks have a loose habit
and need staking. Propagate border
carnations by layering in late summer,
other named forms by softwood cuttings in
early to mid-summer and species by seed
at any time. Is susceptible to rust, red
spider mite and virus infection through
aphids, but many cultivars are available
from virus-free stock.
Carnations and pinks have narrowly
lance-shaped, silvery- or gray-green leaves,
scattered up flower stems, which may coil
outwards on carnations. They are divided
into the following groups, all with
self-colored and bicolored cultivars.
See also feature panel pp.266–67.
Carnations
Border carnations are annuals or
evergreen perennials that flower prolifically
once in mid-summer and are good for
border decoration and cutting. Each stem
bears 5 or more often scented, semidouble
or double flowers, to 3in (8cm) across;
picotee forms (with petals outlined in a
darker color) are available. H 21⁄2–31⁄2ft
(75cm–1.1m), S to 1ft (30cm).
Perpetual-flowering carnations are
evergreen perennials that flower yearround
if grown in a greenhouse, but more
prolifically in summer. They are normally
grown for cut flowers: flower stems should
be disbudded, leaving one terminal bud
per stem. Fully double flowers, to 4in
(10cm) across, are usually unscented and
are often flecked or streaked. H 3–5ft
(1–1.5m), S 1ft (30cm) or more.
Spray forms are not disbudded so have
5 or more flowers per stem, each 2–21⁄2in
(5–6cm) across. H 2–3ft (60cm–1m), S to 1ft
(30cm).
Malmaison carnations are evergreen
perennials, derived from dianthus ‘Souvenir de la
Malmaison’. Grown under glass, they bear
large, double, scented flowers sporadically
during the year. The flowers can reach up
to 5in (13cm) across. They are mostly selfcolored,
and tend to split their calyces.
H 20–28in (50–70cm), S 16in (40cm).
Pinks
Evergreen, clump-forming perennials,
grown for border decoration and cutting,
that in summer produce a succession of
basal shoots, each bearing 4–6 fragrant,
single to fully double flowers, 11⁄2–21⁄2in
(3.5–6cm) across. H 12–18in (30–45cm),
S 9–12in (23–30cm) or more.
Old-fashioned pinks have a low,
spreading habit and produce masses of
flowers in one flowering period in midsummer.
Mule types (a border carnation
crossed with a Sweet William) and laced
types (in which the central color extends as
a loop around each petal) are available.
Modern pinks, obtained by crossing an
old-fashioned pink with a perpetualflowering
carnation, are more vigorous
than old-fashioned pinks, and are repeatflowering
with 2 or 3 main flushes of
flowers in summer.
Alpine pinks are evergreen species and
cultivars forming neat mat or cushion
plants. They will grow at the edge of
borders or in rock gardens, troughs or

FUCHSIA
ONAGRACEAE
Genus of deciduous or evergreen shrubs
and trees, grown for their flowers, usually
borne from early summer to early fall. If
temperature remains above 39°F (4°C),
deciduous plants are evergreen, but
temperatures above 90°F (32°C) should
be avoided. Prolonged low temperatures
cause loss of top growth. If top growth
dies in winter, cut back to ground level
in spring. Needs a sheltered, partially
shaded position, except where stated
otherwise, and fertile, moist but welldrained
soil. When grown as container
plants in a greenhouse, fuchsias also need
high-nitrogen feeds and, when flowering,
plenty of potash. Propagate by softwood
cuttings in any season.
Tubular flowers are almost always
pendulous and often bicolored, with petals
of one hue, and a tube and 4 sepals of
another. Leaves are oval and mid-green
unless otherwise stated. Spherical to
cylindrical, usually blackish-purple fruits
are edible, but mostly poor-flavored.
Upright types may be trained as compact
bushes or standards or, with more
difficulty, as pyramids. Lax or trailing
plants are good for hanging baskets, but
may be trained on trellises; if they are used
for summer bedding, they require staking.
Heights given in descriptions below are of
plants grown in frost-free conditions. See

GLADIOLUS
IRIDACEAE
Genus of corms, each producing a spike
of funnel-shaped flowers and a fan of
erect, sword-shaped leaves on basal part
of flower stem. Is suitable for cutting or
for planting in mixed borders; most
hybrids are also good for exhibition.
Needs sun and fertile, well-drained soil.
Plant 4–6in (10–15cm) deep and the same
distance apart in spring. Water well in
summer and support tall cultivars with
canes. Lift half-hardy types in fall, cut off
stems and dry corms in a frost-free but
cool place. Pot up spring-flowering
species and cultivars in fall and place in
a cool greenhouse; after flowering, dry
off corms during summer months and
repot in fall.
Propagate by seed or by removal of
young cormlets from parent. Seed sown
in early spring in a cool greenhouse will
take 2–3 years to flower and may not
breed true to type. Cormlets, removed
after lifting, should be stored in frost-free
conditions and then be planted out 2in
(5cm) deep in spring; lift in winter as
for mature corms. They will flower in
1–2 years.
While in storage, corms may be attacked
by various rots. Protect sound, healthy
corms by dusting with a fungicide or
soaking in a fungicide solution before
drying; store in an airy, cool, frost-free
place. Gladiolus scab causes blotches
on leaves; gladiolus yellows shows as
GLADIOLUS
yellowing stripes on leaves, which then
die; in both cases, destroy affected corms.
As a preventative measure, always plant
healthy corms in a new site each year.

GRASSES, BAMBOOS,
RUSHES AND SEDGES
Group of evergreen or herbaceous,
perennial and annual grasses or grasslike
plants belonging to the Gramineae
(including Bambusoideae), Juncaceae
and Cyperaceae families. They are grown
mainly as foliage plants, adding grace
and contrast to borders and rock gardens,
although several grasses have attractive
flower heads in summer that may be dried
for winter decoration. Dead foliage may
be cut back on herbaceous perennials
when dormant. Propagate species by seed
in spring or fall or by division in spring,
selected forms by division only. Pests and
diseases usually give little trouble. Grasses,
bamboos, rushes and sedges are illustrated
on pp.284–49.
Grasses (Gramineae)
Family of evergreen, semievergreen
or herbaceous, sometimes creeping
perennials, annuals and marginal water
plants, usually with rhizomes or stolons,
that form tufts, clumps or carpets. All
have basal leaves and rounded flower
stems that bear alternate, long, narrow
leaves. Flowers are bisexual (males and
females in same spikelet) and are
arranged in panicles, racemes or spikes.
Each flower head comprises spikelets,
with one or more florets, that are covered
with glumes (scales) from which awns
(long, slender bristles) may grow. Unless
otherwise stated, grasses will tolerate
a range of light conditions and flourish
in any well-drained soil. Many genera,
such as Briza, self-seed readily. See

Arrhenatherum, Arundo, Bouteloua, Briza,

Zea and Zizania.
Bamboos (Bambusoideae)
Sub-family of Gramineae, comprising
evergreen, rhizomatous perennials,
sometimes grown as hedging as well as
for ornamentation. Most bamboos differ
from other perennial grasses in that they
have woody stems (culms). These are
hollow (except in Chusquea), mostly
greenish-brown and, due to their silica
content, very strong, with a circumference
of up to 6in (15cm) in some tropical species.
Leaves are lance-shaped with cross veins
that give a tessellated appearance, which
may be obscured in the more tender
species. Flowers are produced at varying
intervals but are not decorative. After
flowering, stems die down but few plants
die completely. Bamboos thrive in a
sheltered, not too dry situation in sun
or shade, unless otherwise stated. See
also Bambusa, Chusquea, Fargesia,
Himalayacalamus, Phyllostachys,
Pleioblastus, Pseudosasa, Sasa,
Semiarundinaria, Shibataea and Yushania.
Rushes (Juncaceae)
Family of evergreen, tuft-forming or
creeping, mostly rhizomatous annuals
and perennials. All have either rounded,
GYNURA
leafless stems or stems bearing long,
narrow, basal leaves that are flat and
hairless except Luzula (woodrushes)
which has flat leaves, edged with
white hairs. Rounded flower heads are
generally unimportant. Most rushes
prefer sun or partial shade and a moist
or wet situation, but Luzula prefers drier
conditions. See also Isolepis, Juncus
and Luzula.
Sedges (Cyperaceae)
Family of evergreen, rhizomatous
perennials that form dense tufts. Stems
are triangular and bear long, narrow
leaves, sometimes reduced to scales.
Spikes or panicles of florets covered with
glumes are produced and contain both
male and female flowers, although some
species of Carex have separate male and
female flower heads on the same stem.
Grow in sun or partial shade. Some
sedges grow naturally in water, but many
may be grown in any well-drained soil.
See also Carex, Cyperus, Eleocharis,
Schoenoplectus and Scirpoides.
GREVILLEA

HEATHERS
ERICACEAE
Heathers (otherwise known as heaths) are
evergreen, woody-stemmed shrubs, grown
for their flowers and foliage, both of which
may provide color in the garden all year
round. There are 3 genera: Calluna,
Daboecia and Erica. Calluna has only one
species, cistaceae vulgaris, but it contains a large
number of cultivars that flower mainly
from mid-summer to late fall. Daboecia
has 2 species, both of which are summerflowering.
The largest genus is Erica, which,
although broadly divided into 2 groups—
winter- and summer-flowering species—has
some species also flowering in spring and
fall. They vary in height from tree heaths,
which may grow to 20ft (6m), to dwarf,
prostrate plants that, if planted apart, soon
spread to form a thick mat of groundcover.
Heathers prefer an open, sunny position
and require rich, well-drained soil. Calluna
and Daboecia dislike limestone and must
be grown in acid soil; some species of Erica
tolerate slightly alkaline soil but all are
better grown in acid soils. Prune lightly
after flowering each year to keep plants
bushy and compact. Propagate species
by seed in spring or by softwood cuttings,
division or layering in summer. Seed cannot
be relied onto come true. All cultivars
should be vegetatively propagated.
Heathers are illustrated on p.166.
HEBE
SCROPHULARIACEAE/PLANTAGINACEAE
Genus of evergreen shrubs, grown for their
often dense spikes, panicles or racemes of
flowers and for their foliage. Grows well in
coastal areas. Smaller species and cultivars
are suitable for rock gardens. Requires full
sun and well-drained soil. Growth may be
restricted, or leggy plants tidied, by cutting
back in spring. Propagate by semiripe
cuttings in summer.

HEDERA
ARALIACEAE
Genus of evergreen, woody-stemmed,
trailing perennials and self-clinging
climbers with adventitious rootlets, used
for covering walls and fences and as
groundcover. Takes a year or so to become
established, but thereafter growth is rapid.
On the ground and while climbing, mostly
bears roughly triangular, usually lobed
leaves. Given extra height and access to
light, leaves become less lobed and, in fall,
umbels of small, yellowish-green flowers
are produced, followed by globose, black,
occasionally yellow, fruits. Ivies with green
leaves are very shade tolerant and do well
against a north-facing wall. Those with
variegated or yellow leaves prefer more
light, are usually less hardy and may
sustain frost and wind damage in severe
winters. All prefer well-drained, alkaline
soil. Prune in spring to control height and
spread, and to remove any damaged
growth. Propagate in late summer by
softwood cuttings or rooted layers. Red
spider mite may be a problem when plants
are grown against a south-facing wall or
in dry conditions. T All parts of ivy may
cause severe discomfort if ingested; contact
with the sap may aggravate skin allergies
or irritate skin.

IRIS
IRIDACEAE
Genus of upright, rhizomatous or bulbous
(occasionally fleshy-rooted) perennials,
some of which are evergreen, grown for
their distinctive and colorful flowers. Each
flower has 3 usually large “falls” (pendent or
semi-pendent petals), which in a number of
species have conspicuous beards or crests;
3 generally smaller “standards” (erect,
horizontal or, occasionally, pendent petals);
and a 3-branched style. In many irises, the
style branches are petal-like. Unless
otherwise stated below, flower stems are
unbranched. Green, then brown seed pods
are ellipsoid to cylindrical and often ribbed.
Irises are suitable for borders, rock gardens,
woodlands, watersides, bog gardens, alpine
houses, cold frames and containers. Some
groups thrive only in the specific growing
conditions mentioned below. Propagate
species by division of rhizomes or offsets
in late summer or by seed in fall, named
cultivars by division only.
Botanically, irises are divided into
a number of sub-genera and sections,
and it is convenient, for horticultural
purposes, to use some of these botanical
names for groups of irises with similar
characteristics and requiring comparable
cultural treatment. T All parts may cause
severe discomfort if ingested; contact
with the sap may irritate skin. See also
feature panel pp.224–25.
Rhizomatous These irises have rhizomes
as rootstocks; leaves are sword-shaped and
usually in a basal fan.
Bearded irises are rhizomatous and have
“beards,” consisting of numerous often
colored hairs, along the center of each
fall. In some irises, the end of the beard
is enlarged into the shape of a horn. The
group covers the vast majority of irises,
including many named cultivars, grown
in gardens; all are derived from iris pallida
and related species. Bearded irises thrive
in full sun in fairly rich, well-drained,
preferably slightly alkaline soil. Some are
very tolerant and will grow and flower
reasonably in partial shade in poorer soil.
For horticultural purposes, various
groupings of hybrid bearded irises are
recognized, based mainly on the height
of the plants in flower. These include
Miniature Dwarf, H to 8in (20cm);
Standard Dwarf, H 8–16in (20–40cm);
Intermediate, H 16–28in (40–70cm);
and Tall, H 28in (70cm) or more (this
last category may be further subdivided).
In general, the shorter the iris, the earlier
the flowering season (from early spring
to early summer). Oncocyclus irises are
rhizomatous, with very large and often
bizarrely colored flowers, one to each
stem, which have bearded falls. They
require full sun, sharply drained but
fairly rich soil and, after flowering, a dry
period of dormancy in summer and early
fall. Difficult to cultivate successfully,
they are best grown in an alpine house
or covered frame in climates subject to
summer rains.
Regelia irises are closely related to
Oncocyclus irises, differing in having
bearded standards as well as falls and
in having 2 flowers to each stem. They
require similar conditions of cultivation,
although a few species, such as iris hoogiana,
have proved easier to grow than
Oncocyclus irises. Hybrids between the
2 groups have been raised and are known
as Regeliocyclus irises.
Beardless irises, also rhizomatous, lack
hairs on the falls; most have very similar
cultural requirements to bearded irises
but some prefer heavier soil. Various
groupings are recognized, of which the
following are the most widely known.
Pacific Coast irises, a group of
Californian species and their hybrids,
prefer acidic to neutral soil and grow well
in sun or partial shade, appreciating some
humus in the soil; they are best grown from
seed as they resent being moved. Spuria
irises (I. spuria and its relatives) grow in
sun or partial shade and well-drained
but moist soil. A number of species and
hybrids prefers moist, waterside
conditions; these include the well-known
Siberian irises (I. sibirica and its relatives)
and the Japanese water irises, such as
iris ensata and iris laevigata, which may also
be grown as border plants, but succeed
best in open, sunny, rich, moist positions.
Crested irises, also rhizomatous, have
ridges, or cockscomb-like crests, instead
of beards. They include the Evansia irises,
with often widely spreading, creeping
stolons. Most have very similar cultivation
requirements to bearded irises but some
prefer damp, rich conditions.
Bulbous These irises are distinguished by
having bulbs as storage organs, sometimes
with thickened, fleshy roots, and leaves that
are lance-shaped and channeled; 4-sided
IRIS
(more or less square in cross section); or
almost cylindrical—unlike the flat and
usually sword-shaped leaves of the
rhizomatous irises. Xiphium irises include
the commonly grown Spanish, English and
Dutch irises, which are excellent both for
garden decoration and as cut flowers. All
are easy to cultivate in sunny, well-drained
sites, preferring slightly alkaline conditions,
but also growing well on acidic soil.
Spanish irises are derived from iris xiphium,
which is variable in flower color, from blue
and violet to yellow and white, and
produces its channeled leaves in fall.
English irises have been produced from
iris latifolia, which varies from blue to violet
(occasionally white) and produces its
channeled leaves in spring. Dutch irises
are hybrids of iris xiphium and the related
pale to deep blue iris latifolia. They are
extremely variable in flower color. Juno
irises have bulbs with thickened, fleshy
roots, channeled leaves and very small
standards that are sometimes only bristly
and usually horizontally placed. Although
very beautiful in flower, they are mostly
difficult to grow successfully, requiring the
same cultivation conditions as Oncocyclus
irises to thrive. Care must be taken not
to damage the fleshy roots when
transplanting or dividing clumps.
Reticulata irises include the dwarf,
bulbous irises valuable for flowering early
in the year. Unlike other bulbous irises,
they have netlike bulb tunics and leaves
that are 4-sided, or occasionally cylindrical.
With few exceptions (not described here),
Reticulata irises grow well in open, sunny,
well-drained sites.

LILIUM
LILIACEAE
Genus of mainly summer-flowering bulbs,
grown for their often fragrant, brightly
colored flowers. Each fleshy-scaled bulb
produces one unbranched, leafy stem, in
some cases with annual roots in lower part.
Mostly lance-shaped or linear leaves, to
9in (22cm) long, are scattered or in whorls,
sometimes with bulbils in axils. Flowers,
usually several per stem, are mainly
trumpet- to bowl-shaped or with the
6 petals strongly reflexed to form a
turkscap shape. (Petals of Lilium are known
botanically as perianth segments.) Three
categories of flower size—small, medium
and large—are used in the descriptions
below. For turkscap, bowl-, cup-, and starshaped
flowers: small is up to 2in (5cm)
across; medium is 2–3in (5–7cm) across;
large is over 3in (7cm) across. For trumpetand
funnel-shaped flowers: small is up to
3in (7cm) long; medium is 3–4in (7–10cm)
long; large is over 4in (10cm) long. Each
plant has a spread of up to 12in (30cm).
Needs sun and well-drained soil, unless
otherwise stated. Propagate by seed in fall
or spring, by bulb scales in summer or by
stem bulbils in fall. Virus, fungal diseases,
and lily beetle may cause problems. Lilies
are classified into 9 divisions. See feature
panel pp.388–91.
Division 1 (Asiatic hybrids)
These lilies are derived from various Asiatic
species, including lilium bulbiferum, L.
cernuum, lilium concolor, lilium davidii, L.
lancifolium and lilium x maculatum. The flowers
are borne in racemes or umbels, and are
usually unscented. The leaves are narrowly
ovate and arranged alternatively. There are
3 subdivisions: 1a) upward-facing flowers;
1b) outward-facing flowers; 1c) pendent
flowers.
Division 2 (Martagon hybrids)
Derived primarily from lilium hansonii and L.
martagon, these lilies produce racemes of
turkscap, sometimes scented flowers, and
have whorls of elliptic leaves.
Division 3 (Candidum hybrids)
Derived from lilium candicum and other
European species, except lilium martagon,
these lilies produce sometimes scented,
mostly turkscap flowers, singly or in
umbels or racemes. Leaves are elliptic,
and spirally arranged or scattered.
Division 4 (American hybrids)
Derived from American species, these lilies
bear racemes of sometimes scented, mostly
turkscap, but occasionally funnel-shaped
flowers, and have whorls of lance-shaped
to elliptic leaves.
Division 5 (Longiflorum hybrids)
Derived from lilium formosanum and L.
longiflorum, these lilies bear racemes or
umbels of large, often sweetly scented,
trumpet- or funnel-shaped flowers,
sometimes only 2 or 3 per stem. Leaves
are linear to narrowly lance-shaped, and
scattered.
Division 6 (Trumpet and Aurelian
hybrids)
Derived from Asiatic species, including
lilium regale, lilium henryi and lilium sargentiae, these
lilies bear racemes or umbels of usually
scented flowers. Leaves are elliptic to linear,
and alternate or spirally arranged. There are
4 subdivisions: 6a) trumpet-shaped flowers;
6b) bowl-shaped flowers; 6c) very shallowly
bowl-shaped flowers, some almost flat; 6d)
distinctly recurved flowers.
Division 7 (Oriental hybrids)
Derived from exochorda Asian species, such as
lilium auratum, lilium japonicum and lilium speciosum,
as well as their hybrids with lilium henryi,
these lilies have flowers borne in racemes
or panicles, and are often scented. Leaves
are lance-shaped and alternate. There are 4
subdivisions: 7a) trumpet-shaped flowers;
7b) bowl-shaped flowers; 7c) flat or very
shallowly bowl-shaped flowers; 7d)
turkscap or various recurved flowers.

AMARYLLIDACEAE
Genus of bulbs, grown for their flowers.
Daffodils have usually linear, basal leaves
and a spread of up to 8in (20cm). Each
flower has a trumpet or cup and petals
(botanically known as perianth segments).
Prefers sun or partial shade and welldrained
soil, but Div.8 cultivars (see below)
prefer a sunny site and tolerate lighter
soils. Deadhead flowers and remove the
faded foliage in mid-summer. Most
cultivars increase naturally by offsets;
dense clumps should be divided no sooner
than 6 weeks after flowering every 3–5
years. Propagate species by seed when
fresh, in late summer or fall. Narcissus
yellow stripe virus, basal rot, slugs, large
narcissus fly and bulb and stem eelworm
may cause problems. T Contact with the
sap of daffodils may irritate skin or
aggravate skin allergies. Horticulturally,
Narcissus is split into the following
divisions (see also feature panel pp.404–05).
Div.1 Trumpet—usually solitary flowers
each have a trumpet that is as long as, or
longer than, the petals. Early to late springflowering.
Div.2 Large cupped—solitary flowers
each have a cup at least one-third the
length of, but shorter than, the petals.
Spring-flowering.
Div.3 Small-cupped—flowers are
often borne singly; each has a cup not
more than one-third the length of the
petals. Spring- or early summer-flowering.
Div.4 Double—most have solitary, large,
fully or semidouble flowers, sometimes
scented, with both cup and petals or cup
alone replaced by petaloid structures. Some
have smaller flowers, produced in clusters
of 4 or more, which are often sweetly
fragrant. Spring- or early summerflowering.
Div.5 Triandrus—nodding flowers, with
short, sometimes straight-sided cups and
narrow, reflexed petals, are borne 2–6 per
stem. Flowers are produced in spring.
Div.6 Cyclamineus—flowers are borne
usually 1 or 2 per stem, each with a cup
NARCISSUS
sometimes flanged and often longer than
those of Div.5. Petals are narrow, pointed
and reflexed. Early to mid-spring-flowering.
Div.7 Jonquil and Apodanthus—
sweetly scented flowers are borne usually 2
or more per stem. Cup is short, sometimes
flanged; petals are often flat, fairly broad
and rounded. Spring-flowering.
Div.8 Tazetta—sweetly fragrant flowers
of small-flowered cultivars are borne in
clusters of 12 or more per stem; largeflowered
cultivars have 3 or 4 flowers per
stem. All have a small, often straight-sided
cup and broad, mostly pointed petals. Late
fall- to mid-spring-flowering. Fallflowering
hybrids provide valuable cut
flowers; “prepared” bulbs may be grown
in pots for mid-winter flowering.
Div.9 Poeticus—flowers, sometimes
borne 2 per stem, may be sweetly fragrant.
Each has a small, colored cup and
glistening white petals. Some narcissus poeticus
hybrids are categorized as Div.3 or 8.
Late spring- or early summer-flowering.
Div.10 Bulbocodium—flowers usually
borne singly on very short stems, showing
all the hallmarks of hoop-petticoat daffodils
(N. bulbocodium subsp. bulbocodium),
with insignificant petals and a
disproportionately large, widely flaring
cup. Winter- to spring-flowering.
Div.11 Split-corona—usually solitary
flowers that have cups split for more than
half their length. In (a), Collar daffodils, the
overlapping segments of the cup lie against
the petals, but in (b), Papillon daffodils, the
segments of the cup tend to be narrower,
with their tips arranged at the margin of
the petals. Most flowers fall into category
(a). Spring-flowering.
Div.12 Miscellaneous—a miscellaneous
category containing hybrids with varying,
intermediate flower shapes that cannot be
satisfactorily classified elsewhere. Fall- to
spring-flowering.
Div.13 Daffodils distinguished solely
by botanical name—a wide variety of
flowers showing the huge range of floral
characteristics of wild daffodils, from the
tiny narcissus cyclamineus and the sweetly
scented, many-flowered narcissus tazetta to the
stately trumpet species. Flower in early fall
to early summer.

ORCHIDS
ORCHIDACEAE
Family of perennials, some of which are
evergreen or semievergreen, grown for
their unusual flowers. These consist of
3 outer sepals and 3 inner petals, the
lowest of which, known as the lip, is usually
enlarged and different from the others in
shape, markings and color. There are about
750 genera and 22,500 species, together
with an even greater number of hybrids,
bred partly for their vigor and ease of
care. They are divided into epiphytic and
terrestrial plants. (The spread of an orchid
is indefinite.)
Epiphytic orchids
Epiphytes have more flamboyant flowers
than terrestrial orchids and are more
commonly grown. In the wild, they grow
on tree branches or rocks (lithophytes),
obtaining nourishment through clinging
roots and moisture through aerial roots.
Most consist of a horizontal rhizome, from
which arise vertical, water-storing, often
swollen stems known as pseudobulbs.
Flowers and foliage are produced from
the newest pseudobulbs. Other epiphytes
consist of a continuously growing upright
rhizome; on these, flower spikes appear
in the axils of leaves growing from the
rhizome. In temperate climates, epiphytes
need to be grown under glass.
Cultivation of epiphytes
For cultivation purposes, epiphytes, which
are all tender (they cannot withstand
freezing temperatures), may be divided
into three groups: cool-greenhouse types,
which require min. 50°F (10°C) and max.
75°F (24°C); intermediate-greenhouse
types, needing a range of 55–80°F
(13–27°C); and warm-greenhouse types,
requiring 65–80°F (18–27°C). In summer,
temperatures need to be controlled by
shading the glass and by ventilation.
Cool-greenhouse orchids may be placed
outdoors in summer; this improves
flowering. Other types may also be grown
outdoors if the air temperature remains
within these ranges.
The amount of light required in summer
is given in individual plant entries.
All epiphytic orchids, however, need
to be kept out of direct sun in summer
to avoid scorching, and require full
light in winter.
Epiphytic orchids, whether grown
indoors or outside, require a special soilfree
compost obtained from an orchid
nursery or made by mixing 2 parts fibrous
material (such as bark chippings and/or
peat) with 1 part porous material (such as
moss and/or expanded clay pellets). Most
epiphytes may be grown in pots, although
some may be successfully cultivated in a
hanging basket or on a slab of bark (with
moss around their roots) suspended in the
greenhouse.
In summer, water plants freely and spray
regularly. Those suspended on bark slabs
need a constantly moist atmosphere. In
winter, water moderately and, if plants
are in growth, spray occasionally. Some
orchids rest in winter and require scarcely
any water or none at all. Orchids benefit
from weak foliar feeds; apply as for
watering. Repot plants every other year,
in spring; if they are about to flower, repot
after flowering.
Terrestrial orchids
Terrestrial orchids, some of which also
produce pseudobulbs, grow in soil or
leaf mold, sustaining themselves in the
normal way through roots or tubers.
Some may be grown in borders, but many
in temperate climates need to be cultivated
in pots and protected under glass in winter.
Cultivation of terrestrial orchids
Terrestrial orchids are hardy to tender, min.
OSBECKIA
65°F (18°C). Cypripedium species may be
grown outdoors in any area, preferably in
neutral to acid soil, but cannot withstand
severe frost, if frozen solid in pots or
without snow cover, or tolerate very wet
soil in winter. Other terrestrial orchids,
except in very mild areas, are best grown
in pots; use the same compost as for
epiphytes but add 1 part grit to 2 parts
compost. Place pots outdoors in a peat bed
or in a glasshouse in the growing season.
Keep dry when dormant. Under glass,
light requirements, watering, feeding
and repotting are as for epiphytes.
Orchid propagation
Orchids with pseudobulbs may be
increased by removing and replanting
old, leafless pseudobulbs when repotting
in spring. Take care to retain at least
4 pseudobulbs on the parent plant. Some
genera that may be propagated in this
way are: Ada, x Aliceara, Anguloa, Bletilla,
Brassavola (large plants only and retaining
at least 6 pseudobulbs on the parent),
x Brassocattleya, Bulbophyllum, Calanthe,
Cattleya, Coelogyne, Cymbidium,
Dendrobium, Dendrochilum, Encyclia,
Gomesa, Gongora, Laelia, Lycaste,
Maxillariella, Miltonia, Miltoniopsis,
Oncidium, Phaius, Pleione, Stanhopea
and Zygopetalum.
Some orchids without pseudobulbs
produce new growth from the base.
When a plant has 6 new growths, divide
it in spring into 2 and repot both portions.
Propagate Disa, Paphiopedilum and
Phragmipedium in this way. Large
specimens of Eria and Masdevallia may
be divided in spring, leaving 4–6 stems
on each portion.
Propagation of Phalaenopsis is by stem
cuttings taken soon after flowering.
Vanda may be increased by removing
the top half of the stem once it has
produced aerial roots and leaves; new
growths will develop from the leafless
base. With both these methods, achieving
success is difficult and not recommended
for the beginner.
Propagate terrestrial orchids with tubers
by division of the tubers. Genera that may
be increased in this way are: Cypripedium
(in spring), Dactylorhiza (spring), Ophrys
(fall), Serapias (fall) and Spiranthes (spring).
Calypso is rarely propagated successfully
in cultivation. Angraecum should not be
propagated in cultivation, because the
parent plant is easily endangered.
Propagate Ponerorchis by small tubers that
form around the base of the stem, when
repotting tubers before growth commences
in early spring. Seedlings may appear in
the compost around the parent plant.
The most easily increased orchids are
Cymbidium. Propagation of Epidendrum
may be extremely difficult; see genus for
specific details.
Orchids are illustrated on pp.466–67.

may be damaged by late spring frosts.
Prefers sun (but tolerates partial shade) and
rich, well-drained soil. Tall and very largeflowered
cultivars need support. Propagate
all species by seed in fall (may take up to
3 years to germinate), tuberous species by
root cuttings in winter, tree peonies by
semiripe cuttings in late summer or by
grafting in winter. Perennials may also be
propagated by division in fall or early
spring. Is prone to peony wilt. T All parts
can cause mild stomach upset if ingested.

Flower forms
Unless stated otherwise, peonies described
below flower between late spring and early
to mid-summer and have large, alternate
leaves divided into oval to lance-shaped or
linear leaflets. Flowers are single,
semidouble, double or anemone-form.
Single—flowers are mostly cup-shaped,
with 1 or 2 rows of large, often lightly
ruffled, incurving petals and a conspicuous
central boss of stamens.
Semidouble—flowers are similar to single
ones, but have 2 or 3 rows of petals.
Double—flowers are rounded, usually
composed of 1 or 2 outer rows of large,
often lightly ruffled, incurving petals, the
remaining petals being smaller, usually
becoming more densely arranged and
diminishing in size toward the center.
Stamens are few, inconspicuous or absent.
Anemone-form (Imperial or Japanese)—
flowers usually have 1 or 2 rows of broad,
incurving, outer petals; the center of the
flower is often filled entirely with numerous
densely arranged, sometimes deeply cut,
narrow petaloids derived from stamens.

grown as annuals, with showy, colorful
flowers. Needs a sunny, sheltered position
and fertile, well-drained soil. Deadhead
regularly. Propagate by seed sown under
glass in fall or mid-spring. May suffer from
viruses, including cucumber mosaic and
tomato spotted wilt.
The many cultivars that have been
produced are moderately fast-growing,
branching, bushy plants, H 6–12in (15–30cm),
S 12in (30cm), with oval, mid- to deep green
leaves, usually 2–5in (5–12cm) long. In
summer–fall, they produce flared,
trumpet-shaped, single or double flowers in
a wide range of colors (available in mixtures
or singly), including blue, violet, purple, red,
pink and white. Some have dark veining,
central white stars, halos (throats in
contrasting colors), or picotee margins.
Petunias are generally hardy in Z11 H12–1.
The cultivars are divided into 2 groups,
Grandiflora and Multiflora petunias.
Grandiflora petunias have very large
flowers, 3–4in (8–10cm) wide, but they are
easily damaged by rain and are best grown
in sheltered hanging baskets and pots.
Multiflora petunias are bushier than
the Grandiflora petunias, and produce
smaller flowers, 2in (5cm) wide, in greater
quantity. They tend to be more resistant to
rain damage, and are excellent for summer
bedding or for a mixed border.

POTENTILLA
ROSACEAE
Genus of perennials and deciduous shrubs,
grown for their clusters of small, flattish to
saucer-shaped flowers and for their foliage.
Tall species—particularly the shrubs—are
useful in borders. Dwarf potentillas are
POTENTILLA
good for rock gardens. Prefers full sun, but
flower color is better on orange-, red- and
pink-flowered cultivars if they are shaded
from hottest sun. Needs well-drained soil.
Propagate perennial species by seed in fall
or by division in spring or fall, and selected
forms by division only in spring or fall;
shrubby species may be raised by seed in
fall or by softwood or greenwood cuttings
in summer, and selected forms by softwood
or greenwood cuttings in summer.

PRIMULA
PRIMULACEAE
Genus of mainly herbaceous perennials,
some woody-based and evergreen. All have
leaves in basal rosettes and tubular, bell- or
primrose-shaped flowers. In some primulas,
the flower stems, leaves, sepals and,
occasionally, sections of the petals are
covered with a waxy powder known as
farina. There are primulas suitable for
almost every type of site: the border, scree
garden, rock garden, peat garden, bog
garden, pond margin, greenhouse and
alpine house. Some may be difficult to grow
as they dislike winter damp or summer
heat. Repot pot-grown plants annually.
Tidy up fading foliage and deadhead as
flowering ceases. Propagate species by seed
when fresh or in spring, selected forms
when dormant, by division in fall–spring
or by root cuttings in winter, auricula
primulas by offsets in early spring or early
fall. Border cultivars may be prone to slug
damage in damp places and to attack by
root aphids when grown in very dry
conditions or in pots. Primulas are divided
into many different horticultural groups,
of which the following are in common use.
See also feature panel pp.258–9.
Auricula primulas
These are evergreen primulas, derived
from hybrids between primula auricula and
primula hirsuta, producing flat, smooth flowers
carried in an umbel on a stem above the
foliage. There are 3 main subgroups:
alpine, show and border.
Alpine Auricula Group. In these, the
color of the flower center is strikingly
different from that of the petals. They may
be either light-centered (white or pale in
the center) or gold-centered (yellow or gold
in the center). There is no meal or “farina”
on either leaves or flowers. Grow in an
alpine house or rock garden.
Show Auricula Group has flowers with
a distinct circle of white meal or “paste” in
the center. Some are self-colored, with one
color, which may be red, yellow, blue or
violet, from the central paste to the petal
margins; edged cultivars have a black ring
surrounding the central paste, feathering
out to an often green, gray or white
margin; in fancy cultivars, the paste is
surrounded by a color other than black,
with a green, gray or white margin. Show
Auriculas have white farina on their foliage
(except those with green-edged flowers),
on their flower eyes and, sometimes, on
their petal margins. Grow under glass to
protect flowers from rain.
Border Auricula Group has generally
robust, garden Auricula primulas, which
are often very fragrant. Some have farina
on flower stems and leaves. Grow in a
mixed or herbaceous border.
Candelabra primulas
These are robust, herbaceous perennials
with tubular, flat-faced flowers borne in
tiered whorls up tall, sturdy stems. Some
are deciduous, dying back to basal buds;
others are semievergreen, dying back to
reduced rosettes. Grow in moist shade or
woodland, especially by streams.
Primrose-Polyanthus primulas
A diverse group of evergreen,
semievergreen or deciduous perennial
hybrids, derived from primula vulgaris, crossed
with primula veris, primula juliae and other species.
They are divided into two main groups.
Primrose Group Most produce solitary
flowers among the leaves. Are mainly
grown as herbaceous perennials, flowering
in spring, or as biennial greenhouse
container plants flowering in winterspring.
Polyanthus Group Produce flowers
in long-stalked umbels. Usually grown as
biennials for bedding, sown in summer to
flower in winter and the following spring,
or under glass as winter- and springflowering
container plants.
Cultivation
Primulas have varying cultivation
requirements. For ease of reference, these
have been grouped as follows:
1—Full sun or partial shade, in moist, but
well-drained, rich soil.
2—Partial shade, in deep, rich, moist,
neutral to acidic soil.
3—Deep or partial shade, in peaty, gritty,
moist but very well-drained, acidic soil.
Protect from excessive winter wet.
4—Under glass in an alpine house or
frame. Avoid wetting foliage of mealy
species and hybrids.
5—Full sun with some midday shade,
or partial shade, in rich, moist but welldrained,
gritty, slightly alkaline soil.
6—In a cool or temperate greenhouse,
or as a houseplant, in bright, filtered light.

by seed in fall, deciduous hybrids and
selected forms by softwood cuttings in
summer, evergreens by semiripe cuttings
in summer. Birds may eat flower buds and
foliage may be attacked by aphids,
caterpillars and the fungal disease silver
leaf. Flowering cherries are prone to a
fungus that causes “witches’ brooms”
(abnormal, crowded shoots). Certain

shade, but a considerable number tolerates
full sun, especially in cool climates. Needs
neutral to acid soil—ideally, rich and welldrained.
Shallow planting is essential, as
plants are surface-rooting. Deadhead spent
flowers, wherever practical, to encourage
energy into growth rather than seed
production. Propagate by layering or
semiripe cuttings in late summer. Yellowing
leaves are usually caused by poor drainage,
excessively deep planting or lime in soil.
Weevils and powdery mildew may also
cause problems. T The nectar of some
rhododendron flowers may cause severe
discomfort if ingested. See also feature
panel pp.124–125.
Rhododendrons and azaleas
The genus Rhododendron includes not

ROSA
ROSACEAE
Genus of deciduous or semievergreen,
open shrubs and scrambling climbers,
grown for their profusion of flowers, often
fragrant, and sometimes for their fruits
(rose hips). Leaves are divided into usually
5 or 7 oval leaflets, with rounded or
pointed tips, that are sometimes toothed.
Stems usually bear thorns, or prickles.
Most of the bush and climbing roses grow
well in Z5–9 H9–5 (unless otherwise stated)
but are often grown in colder zones and
protected for the winter by mounding,
deep planting, or burying. Prefers an open,
sunny site and requires fertile, moist but
well-drained soil. Avoid planting in an area
where roses have been grown in recent
years, as problems due to harmful
organisms may occur: either exchange
the soil, which may be used satisfactorily
elsewhere, or choose another site for the
new rose. To obtain blooms of high quality,
feed in late winter or early spring with a
balanced fertilizer and apply a mulch. In
spring and summer, feed regularly at
3-weekly intervals. Remove spent flower
heads from plants that are “remontant”
(“rising up again”; other terms used are
repeat- or perpetual-flowering). May be
trimmed for tidiness in early winter. To
improve health, flower quality and shape
of bush, prune in the dormant season or,
preferably, in early spring, before young
shoots develop from dormant growth
buds: remove dead, damaged and dying
wood; lightly trim Old Garden and
Groundcover roses (see below); remove
two-thirds of previous summer’s growth of
Modern bush, including miniature, roses.
Correct treatment of Modern shrub and
climbing roses, ramblers and Species roses
depends on the individual cultivar, but in
general they should be pruned only lightly.
Propagate by budding in summer or by
hardwood cuttings in fall. All roses are
prone to attack by various pests and
diseases, including aphids, blackspot,
powdery mildew, rust and sawfly.
Rose species and cultivars are often
regarded as 2 separate groups. Cultivars
are farther divided into Old Garden and
Modern roses. Each group comprises
different types, based, it is claimed, on the
functional qualities of each plant, such as
whether it is repeat-flowering, rather than
on any historical, botanical or genetical
relationships. Flowers occur in a variety of
forms (illustrated and described on p.172).
and are single (4–7 petals), semidouble
(8–20 petals), double (20–30 petals) or fully
double (over 30 petals). Many modern rose
cultivars are sold under names other than
the registered Plant Breeder’s Rights (PBR)
names; where this is the case, the plant is
listed under its trade name, with the PBR
name in brackets afterwards. Roses are
illustrated on pp.172–187.
Species roses
Species, or wild, roses (including those
interspecific hybrids that share most of
the characteristics of their parent species)
are either shrubs or climbers, mostly
bearing single, 5-petaled, often fragrant
flowers in summer, usually in one flush
on short shoots from second-year wood;
the flowers are followed by red or black
hips in fall.
Old Garden roses
This category is so large that it is divided
into two groups. Roses in Group A are
mostly of European origin, while those
in Group B are hybrids between Oriental
and European roses.
Group A
Alba—large, freely branching shrubs with
only a few prickles on the stems. They
bear clusters of 5–7 semi- to fully double,
scented flowers in mid-summer, on shoots
from second-year wood. Have abundant,
grayish-green leaves. Most are good for
borders and as hedges or as specimen
plants.
Centifolia (or Provence)—lax, thorny
shrubs that produce often scented, double
to fully double flowers, borne singly or in
3s, in summer, on shoots from second-year
wood. Leaves are matt, dark green. Are
suitable for borders.
Damask—open shrubs with prickly stems
and downy leaves. They produce often
very fragrant, semi- to fully double flowers,
borne singly or in loose clusters of 5–7
mainly in summer, on shoots from secondyear
wood; a few also flower on new wood
in fall. Are suitable for borders or training
against a support.
Gallica—shrubs of fairly dense, freebranching
habit, with usually thorny
stems, and mostly dull, dark green leaves.
Produce mostly scented, single to fully
double, richly colored flowers, often in
clusters of 3, in summer on shoots from
second-year wood. Are suitable for
borders and as hedging.
Moss—often lax shrubs with a furry,
mosslike growth on stems and calyces.
Leaves are usually dark green. Usually
fragrant, semi- to fully double flowers,
often in clusters of 3 or more, are borne
on very thorny shoots from second-year
wood in summer. Are suitable for beds
and borders.
Scots (or Scotch)—suckering shrubs,
selections or hybrids of rosa spinosissima,
of low, spreading, rarely upright habit,
with prickly stems and dark green leaves.
Occasionally scented, single to double
flowers are solitary or borne in clusters
of 3 or more, on short stems from secondyear
wood, usually in early summer. Are
suitable for beds and borders.
Sweet Briar—vigorous, free-branching
shrubs with usually thorny stems and
sweetly scented, dark green leaves. In
summer, they bear usually scented, single
to double flowers, singly or in clusters of
up to 7, on short shoots from second-year
wood. Use as hedges, as specimen plants
and in large borders.
Group B
Bourbon—large, open, repeat-flowering
shrubs and climbing roses, often with long,
smooth or prickly stems, which may be
trained to climb. They have often glossy
leaves and numerous scented, double or
fully double flowers, borne commonly in
3s, in flushes in summer and usually fall.
Flowers are borne on short shoots from
second-year wood and on new wood. Are
suitable for borders and for training over
fences, walls and pillars.
Boursault—climbing roses with long,
arching, usually smooth stems and dark
green leaves. They bear slightly scented,
semidouble or double flowers, singly or
in clusters of 3, in early summer, on short
shoots from second-year wood. Are
suitable for sheltered walls and fences.
China—spindly, repeat-flowering shrubs
with mostly smooth stems, bearing only
a few reddish-brown prickles, and glossy
leaves. They produce sometimes scented,
single to fully double flowers, singly or in
clusters of 3–13, in flushes in summer–fall.
Flowers appear on short shoots from
second-year wood and on new wood.
Need a sheltered site. Are suitable for
borders and walls.
Hybrid Musk—vigorous, repeatflowering
shrubs with prickly stems and
abundant foliage. They produce mainly
double blooms, often very fragrant, either
singly or in clusters of 2–7 or more, in
flushes from mid-summer to fall. Are good
for shrub borders, and can be trained on
walls.
Hybrid Perpetual—free-branching,
repeat-flowering shrubs with upright,
prickly growth and dark green leaves. They
bear often scented, fully double flowers,
held singly or in 3s, in flushes in summer–
fall on shoots from second-year wood and
on new wood. Are suitable for beds and
borders.

Remove flower heads from newly planted
lilacs, and dead-head for first few years.
Cut out weak shoots in winter and, to
maintain shape, prune after flowering.
Straggly, old plants may be cut back hard
in winter, but the next season’s flowers
will then be lost. Propagate by softwood
cuttings in summer. Leaf miners, leaf spot
and lilac blight may be troublesome. See
